While it's possible to write correct programs even with a suboptimal state structure, there are a few principles that can guide you to make better choices:</p> <ol> <li>Group related state. If you always update two or more state variables at the same time, consider merging them into a single state variable.</li> <li>Avoid contradictions in state. When the state is structured in a way that several pieces of state may contradict and \"disagree\" with each other, you leave room for mistakes. Try to avoid this.</li> <li>Avoid redundant state. If you can calculate some information from the component's props or its existing state variables during rendering, you should not put that information into that component's state.</li> <li>Avoid duplication in state. When the same data is duplicated between multiple state variables, or within nested objects, it is difficult to keep them in sync. Reduce duplication when you can.</li> <li>Avoid deeply nested state. Deeply hierarchical state is not very convenient to update. When possible, prefer to structure state in a flat way.</li> </ol> <p>The goal behind these principles is to make state easy to update without introducing mistakes. Removing redundant and duplicate data from state helps ensure that all its pieces stay in sync. This is similar to how a database engineer might want to \"normalize\" the database structure to reduce the chance of bugs. To paraphrase Albert Einstein, \"Make your state as simple as it can be--but no simpler.\"</p> <p>Now let's see how these principles apply in action.</p>"},{"location":"learn/choosing-the-state-structure/#group-related-state","title":"Group related state","text":"<p>You might sometimes be unsure between using a single or multiple state variables.</p> <p>Should you do this?</p> <pre><code>const [x, setX] = useState(0);\nconst [y, setY] = useState(0);\n</code></pre> <p>Or this?</p> <pre><code>const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n</code></pre> <p>Technically, you can use either of these approaches. But if some two state variables always change together, it might be a good idea to unify them into a single state variable. Then you won't forget to always keep them in sync, like in this example where moving the cursor updates both coordinates of the red dot:</p> <pre><code>import { useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function MovingDot() {\nconst [position, setPosition] = useState({\nx: 0,\ny: 0,\n});\nreturn (\n&lt;div\nonPointerMove={(e) =&gt; {\nsetPosition({\nx: e.clientX,\ny: e.clientY,\n});\n}}\nstyle={{\nposition: \"relative\",\nwidth: \"100vw\",\nheight: \"100vh\",\n}}\n&gt;\n&lt;div\nstyle={{\nposition: \"absolute\",\nbackgroundColor: \"red\",\nborderRadius: \"50%\",\ntransform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,\nleft: -10,\ntop: -10,\nwidth: 20,\nheight: 20,\n}}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>body {\nmargin: 0;\npadding: 0;\nheight: 250px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Another case where you'll group data into an object or an array is when you don't know how many pieces of state you'll need. For example, it's helpful when you have a form where the user can add custom fields.</p> <p> <p>If your state variable is an object, remember that you can't update only one field in it without explicitly copying the other fields. For example, you can't do <code>setPosition({ x: 100 })</code> in the above example because it would not have the <code>y</code> property at all! Instead, if you wanted to set <code>x</code> alone, you would either do <code>setPosition({ ...position, x: 100 })</code>, or split them into two state variables and do <code>setX(100)</code>.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"learn/choosing-the-state-structure/#avoid-contradictions-in-state","title":"Avoid contradictions in state","text":"<p>Here is a hotel feedback form with <code>isSending</code> and <code>isSent</code> state variables:</p> <pre><code>import { useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function FeedbackForm() {\nconst [text, setText] = useState(\"\");\nconst [isSending, setIsSending] = useState(false);\nconst [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);\n\nasync function handleSubmit(e) {\ne.preventDefault();\nsetIsSending(true);\nawait sendMessage(text);\nsetIsSending(false);\nsetIsSent(true);\n}\n\nif (isSent) {\nreturn &lt;h1&gt;Thanks for feedback!&lt;/h1&gt;;\n}\n\nreturn (\n&lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How was your stay at The Prancing Pony?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;textarea\ndisabled={isSending}\nvalue={text}\nonChange={(e) =&gt; setText(e.target.value)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;button disabled={isSending} type=\"submit\"&gt;\nSend\n&lt;/button&gt;\n{isSending &amp;&amp; &lt;p&gt;Sending...&lt;/p&gt;}\n&lt;/form&gt;\n);\n}\n\n// Pretend to send a message.\nfunction sendMessage(text) {\nreturn new Promise((resolve) =&gt; {\nsetTimeout(resolve, 2000);\n});\n}\n</code></pre> <p>While this code works, it leaves the door open for \"impossible\" states.

When you call <code>setFirstName</code> or <code>setLastName</code>, you trigger a re-render, and then the next <code>fullName</code> will be calculated from the fresh data.</p> <p>"},{"location":"learn/choosing-the-state-structure/#dont-mirror-props-in-state","title":"Don't mirror props in state","text":"<p>A common example of redundant state is code like this:</p> <pre><code>function Message({ messageColor }) {\nconst [color, setColor] = useState(messageColor);\n</code></pre> <p>Here, a <code>color</code> state variable is initialized to the <code>messageColor</code> prop. The problem is that if the parent component passes a different value of <code>messageColor</code> later (for example, <code>'red'</code> instead of <code>'blue'</code>), the <code>color</code> state variable would not be updated! The state is only initialized during the first render.</p> <p>This is why \"mirroring\" some prop in a state variable can lead to confusion.

Here's a few ways you can compare them:</p> <ul> <li>Code size: Generally, with <code>useState</code> you have to write less code upfront. With <code>useReducer</code>, you have to write both a reducer function and dispatch actions. However, <code>useReducer</code> can help cut down on the code if many event handlers modify state in a similar way.</li> <li>Readability: <code>useState</code> is very easy to read when the state updates are simple. When they get more complex, they can bloat your component's code and make it difficult to scan. In this case, <code>useReducer</code> lets you cleanly separate the how of update logic from the what happened of event handlers.</li> <li>Debugging: When you have a bug with <code>useState</code>, it can be difficult to tell where the state was set incorrectly, and why. With <code>useReducer</code>, you can add a console log into your reducer to see every state update, and why it happened (due to which <code>action</code>). If each <code>action</code> is correct, you'll know that the mistake is in the reducer logic itself. However, you have to step through more code than with <code>useState</code>.</li> <li>Testing: A reducer is a pure function that doesn't depend on your component. This means that you can export and test it separately in isolation. While generally it's best to test components in a more realistic environment, for complex state update logic it can be useful to assert that your reducer returns a particular state for a particular initial state and action.</li> <li>Personal preference: Some people like reducers, others don't. That's okay. It's a matter of preference. You can always convert between <code>useState</code> and <code>useReducer</code> back and forth: they are equivalent!</li> </ul> <p>We recommend using a reducer if you often encounter bugs due to incorrect state updates in some component, and want to introduce more structure to its code. You don't have to use reducers for everything: feel free to mix and match!

Similar to state updater functions, reducers run during rendering! (Actions are queued until the next render.) This means that reducers must be pure\u2014same inputs always result in the same output. They should not send requests, schedule timeouts, or perform any side effects (operations that impact things outside the component). They should update objects and arrays without mutations.</li> <li>Each action describes a single user interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in the data. For example, if a user presses \"Reset\" on a form with five fields managed by a reducer, it makes more sense to dispatch one <code>reset_form</code> action rather than five separate <code>set_field</code> actions. If you log every action in a reducer, that log should be clear enough for you to reconstruct what interactions or responses happened in what order.

For example, you could write <code>import Banana from './Button.js'</code> instead and it would still provide you with the same default export. In contrast, with named imports, the name has to match on both sides. That's why they are called named imports!</p> <p>People often use default exports if the file exports only one component, and use named exports if it exports multiple components and values. Regardless of which coding style you prefer, always give meaningful names to your component functions and the files that contain them.

Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.</li> </ul> <p>You might already be familiar with one example of pure functions: formulas in math.</p> <p>Consider this math formula: y = 2x.</p> <p>If x = 2 then y = 4.

This means that calling this component multiple times will produce different JSX! And what's more, if other components read <code>guest</code>, they will produce different JSX, too, depending on when they were rendered!

However, you still need to be careful: for example, if you tried to change any of the array's existing items, you'd have to clone those items too.</p> <p>It is useful to remember which operations on arrays mutate them, and which don't. For example, <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>reverse</code>, and <code>sort</code> will mutate the original array, but <code>slice</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>map</code> will create a new one.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects/","title":"Lifecycle of Reactive Effects \ud83d\udea7","text":""},{"location":"learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>  Effects have a different lifecycle from components.

That's where the mistakes usually are.</p> <p></p> <pre><code>import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\nconst [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });\nconst [canMove, setCanMove] = useState(true);\n\nfunction handleMove(e) {\nif (canMove) {\nsetPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });\n}\n}\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nwindow.addEventListener(\"pointermove\", handleMove);\nreturn () =&gt; window.removeEventListener(\"pointermove\", handleMove);\n// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\n}, []);\n\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;\n&lt;input\ntype=\"checkbox\"\nchecked={canMove}\nonChange={(e) =&gt; setCanMove(e.target.checked)}\n/&gt;\nThe dot is allowed to move\n&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;div\nstyle={{\nposition: \"absolute\",\nbackgroundColor: \"pink\",\nborderRadius: \"50%\",\nopacity: 0.6,\ntransform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,\npointerEvents: \"none\",\nleft: -20,\ntop: -20,\nwidth: 40,\nheight: 40,\n}}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>body {\nheight: 200px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p> <p>The problem with the original code was suppressing the dependency linter. If you remove the suppression, you'll see that this Effect depends on the <code>handleMove</code> function. This makes sense: <code>handleMove</code> is declared inside the component body, which makes it a reactive value. Every reactive value must be specified as a dependency, or it can potentially get stale over time!</p> <p>The author of the original code has \"lied\" to React by saying that the Effect does not depend (<code>[]</code>) on any reactive values. This is why React did not re-synchronize the Effect after <code>canMove</code> has changed (and <code>handleMove</code> with it). Because React did not re-synchronize the Effect, the <code>handleMove</code> attached as a listener is the <code>handleMove</code> function created during the initial render. During the initial render, <code>canMove</code> was <code>true</code>, which is why <code>handleMove</code> from the initial render will forever see that value.</p> <p>If you never suppress the linter, you will never see problems with stale values. There are a few different ways to solve this bug, but you should always start by removing the linter suppression. Then change the code to fix the lint error.</p> <p>You can change the Effect dependencies to <code>[handleMove]</code>, but since it's going to be a newly defined function for every render, you might as well remove dependencies array altogether. Then the Effect will re-synchronize after every re-render:</p> <pre><code>import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\nconst [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });\nconst [canMove, setCanMove] = useState(true);\n\nfunction handleMove(e) {\nif (canMove) {\nsetPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });\n}\n}\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nwindow.addEventListener(\"pointermove\", handleMove);\nreturn () =&gt; window.removeEventListener(\"pointermove\", handleMove);\n});\n\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;\n&lt;input\ntype=\"checkbox\"\nchecked={canMove}\nonChange={(e) =&gt; setCanMove(e.target.checked)}\n/&gt;\nThe dot is allowed to move\n&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;div\nstyle={{\nposition: \"absolute\",\nbackgroundColor: \"pink\",\nborderRadius: \"50%\",\nopacity: 0.6,\ntransform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,\npointerEvents: \"none\",\nleft: -20,\ntop: -20,\nwidth: 40,\nheight: 40,\n}}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>body {\nheight: 200px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This solution works, but it's not ideal. If you put <code>console.log('Resubscribing')</code> inside the Effect, you'll notice that it resubscribes after every re-render. Resubscribing is fast, but it would still be nice to avoid doing it so often.</p> <p>A better fix would be to move the <code>handleMove</code> function inside the Effect. Then <code>handleMove</code> won't be a reactive value, and so your Effect won't depend on a function. Instead, it will need to depend on <code>canMove</code> which your code now reads from inside the Effect. This matches the behavior you wanted, since your Effect will now stay synchronized with the value of <code>canMove</code>:</p> <pre><code>import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\nconst [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });\nconst [canMove, setCanMove] = useState(true);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nfunction handleMove(e) {\nif (canMove) {\nsetPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });\n}\n}\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"pointermove\", handleMove);\nreturn () =&gt; window.removeEventListener(\"pointermove\", handleMove);\n}, [canMove]);\n\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;\n&lt;input\ntype=\"checkbox\"\nchecked={canMove}\nonChange={(e) =&gt; setCanMove(e.target.checked)}\n/&gt;\nThe dot is allowed to move\n&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;div\nstyle={{\nposition: \"absolute\",\nbackgroundColor: \"pink\",\nborderRadius: \"50%\",\nopacity: 0.6,\ntransform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,\npointerEvents: \"none\",\nleft: -20,\ntop: -20,\nwidth: 40,\nheight: 40,\n}}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>body {\nheight: 200px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Try adding <code>console.log('Resubscribing')</code> inside the Effect body and notice that now it only resubscribes when you toggle the checkbox (<code>canMove</code> changes) or edit the code. This makes it better than the previous approach that always resubscribed.</p> <p>You'll learn a more general approach to this type of problem in Separating Events from Effects.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects/#fix-a-connection-switch","title":"Fix a connection switch","text":"<p>In this example, the chat service in <code>chat.js</code> exposes two different APIs: <code>createEncryptedConnection</code> and <code>createUnencryptedConnection</code>.

In CSS, you can specify <code>color: blue</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, and any DOM node inside of it, no matter how deep, will inherit that color unless some other DOM node in the middle overrides it with <code>color: green</code>. Similarly, in React, the only way to override some context coming from above is to wrap children into a context provider with a different value.</p> <p>In CSS, different properties like <code>color</code> and <code>background-color</code> don't override each other. You can set all <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>'s <code>color</code> to red without impacting <code>background-color</code>. Similarly, different React contexts don't override each other. Each context that you make with <code>createContext()</code> is completely separate from other ones, and ties together components using and providing that particular context.

However, this also means it's too easy to overuse it. Just because you need to pass some props several levels deep doesn't mean you should put that information into context.</p> <p>Here's a few alternatives you should consider before using context:</p> <ol> <li>Start by passing props. If your components are not trivial, it's not unusual to pass a dozen props down through a dozen components. It may feel like a slog, but it makes it very clear which components use which data! The person maintaining your code will be glad you've made the data flow explicit with props.</li> <li>Extract components and pass JSX as <code>children</code> to them. If you pass some data through many layers of intermediate components that don't use that data (and only pass it further down), this often means that you forgot to extract some components along the way. For example, maybe you pass data props like <code>posts</code> to visual components that don't use them directly, like <code>&lt;Layout posts={posts} /&gt;</code>. Instead, make <code>Layout</code> take <code>children</code> as a prop, and render <code>&lt;Layout&gt;&lt;Posts posts={posts} /&gt;&lt;/Layout&gt;</code>. This reduces the number of layers between the component specifying the data and the one that needs it.</li> </ol> <p>If neither of these approaches works well for you, consider context.</p>"},{"location":"learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context/#use-cases-for-context","title":"Use cases for context","text":"<ul> <li>Theming: If your app lets the user change its appearance (e.g. dark mode), you can put a context provider at the top of your app, and use that context in components that need to adjust their visual look.</li> <li>Current account: Many components might need to know the currently logged in user. Putting it in context makes it convenient to read it anywhere in the tree. Some apps also let you operate multiple accounts at the same time (e.g. to leave a comment as a different user). In those cases, it can be convenient to wrap a part of the UI into a nested provider with a different current account value.</li> <li>Routing: Most routing solutions use context internally to hold the current route. This is how every link \"knows\" whether it's active or not. If you build your own router, you might want to do it too.</li> <li>Managing state: As your app grows, you might end up with a lot of state closer to the top of your app. Many distant components below may want to change it. It is common to use a reducer together with context to manage complex state and pass it down to distant components without too much hassle.</li> </ul> <p>Context is not limited to static values. If you pass a different value on the next render, React will update all the components reading it below!

Keys aren't just for lists! You can use keys to make React distinguish between any components. By default, React uses order within the parent (\"first counter\", \"second counter\") to discern between components. But keys let you tell React that this is not just a first counter, or a second counter, but a specific counter--for example, Taylor's counter. This way, React will know Taylor's counter wherever it appears in the tree!</p> <p>In this example, the two <code>&lt;Counter /&gt;</code>s don't share state even though they appear in the same place in JSX:</p> <pre><code>import { useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function Scoreboard() {\nconst [isPlayerA, setIsPlayerA] = useState(true);\nreturn (\n&lt;div&gt;\n{isPlayerA ?

This is why, even though you render them in the same place in JSX, React sees them as two different counters, and so they will never share state. Every time a counter appears on the screen, its state is created. Every time it is removed, its state is destroyed.

But this also means that the UI won't be updated until after your event handler, and any code in it, completes. This behavior, also known as batching, makes your React app run much faster. It also avoids dealing with confusing \"half-finished\" renders where only some of the variables have been updated.</p> <p>React does not batch across multiple intentional events like clicks--each click is handled separately. Rest assured that React only does batching when it's generally safe to do.

Try again!\"));\n}\n}, 1500);\n});\n}\n\nlet form = document.getElementById(\"form\");\nlet textarea = document.getElementById(\"textarea\");\nlet button = document.getElementById(\"button\");\nlet loadingMessage = document.getElementById(\"loading\");\nlet errorMessage = document.getElementById(\"error\");\nlet successMessage = document.getElementById(\"success\");\nform.onsubmit = handleFormSubmit;\ntextarea.oninput = handleTextareaChange;\n</code></pre> <pre><code>{\n\"hardReloadOnChange\": true\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>&lt;form id=\"form\"&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;City quiz&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;What city is located on two continents?&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;textarea id=\"textarea\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n    &lt;br /&gt;\n    &lt;button id=\"button\" disabled&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;p id=\"loading\" style=\"display: none\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p id=\"error\" style=\"display: none; color: red;\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;h1 id=\"success\" style=\"display: none\"&gt;That's right!&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;style&gt;\n* {\nbox-sizing: border-box;\n}\nbody {\nfont-family: sans-serif;\nmargin: 20px;\npadding: 0;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Manipulating the UI imperatively works well enough for isolated examples, but it gets exponentially more difficult to manage in more complex systems. Imagine updating a page full of different forms like this one. Adding a new UI element or a new interaction would require carefully checking all existing code to make sure you haven't introduced a bug (for example, forgetting to show or hide something).</p> <p>React was built to solve this problem.</p> <p>In React, you don't directly manipulate the UI--meaning you don't enable, disable, show, or hide components directly. Instead, you declare what you want to show, and React figures out how to update the UI. Think of getting into a taxi and telling the driver where you want to go instead of telling them exactly where to turn. It's the driver's job to get you there, and they might even know some shortcuts you haven't considered!</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"learn/reacting-to-input-with-state/#thinking-about-ui-declaratively","title":"Thinking about UI declaratively","text":"<p>You've seen how to implement a form imperatively above.

If you work with a designer, you may have seen mockups for different \"visual states\". React stands at the intersection of design and computer science, so both of these ideas are sources of inspiration.</p> <p>First, you need to visualize all the different \"states\" of the UI the user might see:</p> <ul> <li>Empty: Form has a disabled \"Submit\" button.</li> <li>Typing: Form has an enabled \"Submit\" button.</li> <li>Submitting: Form is completely disabled. Spinner is shown.</li> <li>Success: \"Thank you\" message is shown instead of a form.</li> <li>Error: Same as Typing state, but with an extra error message.</li> </ul> <p>Just like a designer, you'll want to \"mock up\" or create \"mocks\" for the different states before you add logic. For example, here is a mock for just the visual part of the form. This mock is controlled by a prop called <code>status</code> with a default value of <code>'empty'</code>:</p> <pre><code>export default function Form({ status = \"empty\" }) {\nif (status === \"success\") {\nreturn &lt;h1&gt;That's right!&lt;/h1&gt;;\n}\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;City quiz&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nIn which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable\nwater?\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;form&gt;\n&lt;textarea /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You could call that prop anything you like, the naming is not important.

Here's how state and refs compare:</p> refs state <code>useRef(initialValue)</code> returns <code>{ current: initialValue }</code> <code>useState(initialValue)</code> returns the current value of a state variable and a state setter function ( <code>[value, setValue]</code>) Doesn't trigger re-render when you change it.

Since the Effect depended on these functions, the chat would re-connect every time you toggle the theme.</p> <p>To fix the problem with <code>onMessage</code>, you needed to wrap it into an Effect Event:</p> <pre><code>export default function ChatRoom({ roomId, createConnection, onMessage }) {\nconst onReceiveMessage = useEffectEvent(onMessage);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nconst connection = createConnection();\nconnection.on('message', (msg) =&gt; onReceiveMessage(msg));\n// ...\n</code></pre> <p>Unlike the <code>onMessage</code> prop, the <code>onReceiveMessage</code> Effect Event is not reactive.

As a result, changes to <code>onMessage</code> won't cause the chat to re-connect.</p> <p>You can't do the same with <code>createConnection</code> because it should be reactive. You want the Effect to re-trigger if the user switches between an encrypted and an unencryption connection, or if the user switches the current room. However, because <code>createConnection</code> is a function, you can't check whether the information it reads has actually changed or not. To solve this, instead of passing <code>createConnection</code> down from the <code>App</code> component, pass the raw <code>roomId</code> and <code>isEncrypted</code> values:</p> <pre><code>&lt;ChatRoom\nroomId={roomId}\nisEncrypted={isEncrypted}\nonMessage={(msg) =&gt; {\nshowNotification(\"New message: \" + msg, isDark ? \"dark\" : \"light\");\n}}\n/&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Now you can move the <code>createConnection</code> function inside the Effect instead of passing it down from the <code>App</code>:</p> <pre><code>import {\ncreateEncryptedConnection,\ncreateUnencryptedConnection,\n} from './chat.js';\n\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId, isEncrypted, onMessage }) {\nconst onReceiveMessage = useEffectEvent(onMessage);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nfunction createConnection() {\nconst options = {\nserverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\nroomId: roomId\n};\nif (isEncrypted) {\nreturn createEncryptedConnection(options);\n} else {\nreturn createUnencryptedConnection(options);\n}\n}\n// ...\n</code></pre> <p>After these two changes, your Effect no longer depends on any function values:</p> <pre><code>export default function ChatRoom({ roomId, isEncrypted, onMessage }) { // Reactive values\nconst onReceiveMessage = useEffectEvent(onMessage); // Not reactive\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nfunction createConnection() {\nconst options = {\nserverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\nroomId: roomId // Reading a reactive value\n};\nif (isEncrypted) { // Reading a reactive value\nreturn createEncryptedConnection(options);\n} else {\nreturn createUnencryptedConnection(options);\n}\n}\n\nconst connection = createConnection();\nconnection.on('message', (msg) =&gt; onReceiveMessage(msg));\nconnection.connect();\nreturn () =&gt; connection.disconnect();\n}, [roomId, isEncrypted]); // \u2705 All dependencies declared\n</code></pre> <p>As a result, the chat re-connects only when something meaningful (<code>roomId</code> or <code>isEncrypted</code>) changes:</p> <pre><code>{\n\"dependencies\": {\n\"react\": \"experimental\",\n\"react-dom\": \"experimental\",\n\"react-scripts\": \"latest\",\n\"toastify-js\": \"1.12.0\"\n},\n\"scripts\": {\n\"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\n\"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\n\"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\",\n\"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\"\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>import { useState } from \"react\";\nimport ChatRoom from \"./ChatRoom.js\";\n\nimport { showNotification } from \"./notifications.js\";\n\nexport default function App() {\nconst [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);\nconst [roomId, setRoomId] = useState(\"general\");\nconst [isEncrypted, setIsEncrypted] = useState(false);\n\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;\n&lt;input\ntype=\"checkbox\"\nchecked={isDark}\nonChange={(e) =&gt; setIsDark(e.target.checked)}\n/&gt;\nUse dark theme\n&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;\n&lt;input\ntype=\"checkbox\"\nchecked={isEncrypted}\nonChange={(e) =&gt; setIsEncrypted(e.target.checked)}\n/&gt;\nEnable encryption\n&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;\nChoose the chat room:{\" \"}\n&lt;select\nvalue={roomId}\nonChange={(e) =&gt; setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n&gt;\n&lt;option value=\"general\"&gt;general&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;option value=\"travel\"&gt;travel&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;option value=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;ChatRoom\nroomId={roomId}\nisEncrypted={isEncrypted}\nonMessage={(msg) =&gt; {\nshowNotification(\n\"New message: \" + msg,\nisDark ? \"dark\" : \"light\"\n);\n}}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { experimental_useEffectEvent as useEffectEvent } from \"react\";\nimport {\ncreateEncryptedConnection,\ncreateUnencryptedConnection,\n} from \"./chat.js\";\n\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId, isEncrypted, onMessage }) {\nconst onReceiveMessage = useEffectEvent(onMessage);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nfunction createConnection() {\nconst options = {\nserverUrl: \"https://localhost:1234\",\nroomId: roomId,\n};\nif (isEncrypted) {\nreturn createEncryptedConnection(options);\n} else {\nreturn createUnencryptedConnection(options);\n}\n}\n\nconst connection = createConnection();\nconnection.on(\"message\", (msg) =&gt; onReceiveMessage(msg));\nconnection.connect();\nreturn () =&gt; connection.disconnect();\n}, [roomId, isEncrypted]);\n\nreturn &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the {roomId} room!&lt;/h1&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>export function createEncryptedConnection({ serverUrl, roomId }) {\n// A real implementation would actually connect to the server\nif (typeof serverUrl !== \"string\") {\nthrow Error(\n\"Expected serverUrl to be a string.

In fact, that's what React will use if you don't specify a <code>key</code> at all.

Index as a key often leads to subtle and confusing bugs.</p> <p>Similarly, do not generate keys on the fly, e.g. with <code>key={Math.random()}</code>.

For example, currently, the logic for what to do when a message arrives is hardcoded inside the Hook:</p> <pre><code>export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nconst options = {\nserverUrl: serverUrl,\nroomId: roomId,\n};\nconst connection = createConnection(options);\nconnection.connect();\nconnection.on(\"message\", (msg) =&gt; {\nshowNotification(\"New message: \" + msg);\n});\nreturn () =&gt; connection.disconnect();\n}, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Let's say you want to move this logic back to your component:</p> <pre><code>export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\nconst [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\nuseChatRoom({\nroomId: roomId,\nserverUrl: serverUrl,\nonReceiveMessage(msg) {\nshowNotification('New message: ' + msg);\n}\n});\n// ...\n</code></pre> <p>To make this work, change your custom Hook to take <code>onReceiveMessage</code> as one of its named options:</p> <pre><code>export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nconst options = {\nserverUrl: serverUrl,\nroomId: roomId,\n};\nconst connection = createConnection(options);\nconnection.connect();\nconnection.on(\"message\", (msg) =&gt; {\nonReceiveMessage(msg);\n});\nreturn () =&gt; connection.disconnect();\n}, [roomId, serverUrl, onReceiveMessage]); // \u2705 All dependencies declared\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This will work, but there's one more improvement you can do when your custom Hook accepts event handlers.</p> <p>Adding a dependency on <code>onReceiveMessage</code> is not ideal because it will cause the chat to re-connect every time the component re-renders. Wrap this event handler into an Effect Event to remove it from the dependencies:</p> <pre><code>import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from \"react\";\n// ...\n\nexport function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {\nconst onMessage = useEffectEvent(onReceiveMessage);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nconst options = {\nserverUrl: serverUrl,\nroomId: roomId,\n};\nconst connection = createConnection(options);\nconnection.connect();\nconnection.on(\"message\", (msg) =&gt; {\nonMessage(msg);\n});\nreturn () =&gt; connection.disconnect();\n}, [roomId, serverUrl]); // \u2705 All dependencies declared\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now the chat won't re-connect every time that the <code>ChatRoom</code> component re-renders.

Some duplication is fine. For example, extracting a <code>useFormInput</code> Hook to wrap a single <code>useState</code> call like earlier is probably unnecessary.</p> <p>However, whenever you write an Effect, consider whether it would be clearer to also wrap it in a custom Hook. You shouldn't need Effects very often, so if you're writing one, it means that you need to \"step outside React\" to synchronize with some external system or to do something that React doesn't have a built-in API for. Wrapping it into a custom Hook lets you precisely communicate your intent and how the data flows through it.</p> <p>For example, consider a <code>ShippingForm</code> component that displays two dropdowns: one shows the list of cities, and another shows the list of areas in the selected city. You might start with some code that looks like this:</p> <pre><code>function ShippingForm({ country }) {\nconst [cities, setCities] = useState(null);\n// This Effect fetches cities for a country\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nlet ignore = false;\nfetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)\n.then(response =&gt; response.json())\n.then(json =&gt; {\nif (!ignore) {\nsetCities(json);\n}\n});\nreturn () =&gt; {\nignore = true;\n};\n}, [country]);\n\nconst [city, setCity] = useState(null);\nconst [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);\n// This Effect fetches areas for the selected city\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nif (city) {\nlet ignore = false;\nfetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)\n.then(response =&gt; response.json())\n.then(json =&gt; {\nif (!ignore) {\nsetAreas(json);\n}\n});\nreturn () =&gt; {\nignore = true;\n};\n}\n}, [city]);\n\n// ...\n</code></pre> <p>Although this code is quite repetitive, it's correct to keep these Effects separate from each other. They synchronize two different things, so you shouldn't merge them into one Effect. Instead, you can simplify the <code>ShippingForm</code> component above by extracting the common logic between them into your own <code>useData</code> Hook:</p> <pre><code>function useData(url) {\nconst [data, setData] = useState(null);\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nif (url) {\nlet ignore = false;\nfetch(url)\n.then((response) =&gt; response.json())\n.then((json) =&gt; {\nif (!ignore) {\nsetData(json);\n}\n});\nreturn () =&gt; {\nignore = true;\n};\n}\n}, [url]);\nreturn data;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now you can replace both Effects in the <code>ShippingForm</code> components with calls to <code>useData</code>:</p> <pre><code>function ShippingForm({ country }) {\nconst cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);\nconst [city, setCity] = useState(null);\nconst areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);\n// ...\n</code></pre> <p>Extracting a custom Hook makes the data flow explicit. You feed the <code>url</code> in and you get the <code>data</code> out. By \"hiding\" your Effect inside <code>useData</code>, you also prevent someone working on the <code>ShippingForm</code> component from adding unnecessary dependencies to it.

If you struggle to pick a clear name, it might mean that your Effect is too coupled to the rest of your component's logic, and is not yet ready to be extracted.</p> <p>Ideally, your custom Hook's name should be clear enough that even a person who doesn't write code often could have a good guess about what your custom Hook does, what it takes, and what it returns:</p> <ul> <li>\u2705 <code>useData(url)</code></li> <li>\u2705 <code>useImpressionLog(eventName, extraData)</code></li> <li>\u2705 <code>useChatRoom(options)</code></li> </ul> <p>When you synchronize with an external system, your custom Hook name may be more technical and use jargon specific to that system.

For example, this code example has a mistake (it doesn't \"react\" to <code>roomId</code> or <code>serverUrl</code> changes), but the linter won't warn you about it because the linter only checks direct <code>useEffect</code> calls. It won't know about your Hook.</p> <p>If you're writing an Effect, start by using the React API directly:</p> <pre><code>function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\nconst [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState(\"https://localhost:1234\");\n\n// \u2705 Good: two raw Effects separated by purpose\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nconst connection = createConnection({ serverUrl, roomId });\nconnection.connect();\nreturn () =&gt; connection.disconnect();\n}, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\npost(\"/analytics/event\", { eventName: \"visit_chat\", roomId });\n}, [roomId]);\n\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Then, you can (but don't have to) extract custom Hooks for different high-level use cases:</p> <pre><code>function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\nconst [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState(\"https://localhost:1234\");\n\n// \u2705 Great: custom Hooks named after their purpose\nuseChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId });\nuseImpressionLog(\"visit_chat\", { roomId });\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A good custom Hook makes the calling code more declarative by constraining what it does. For example, <code>useChatRoom(options)</code> can only connect to the chat room, while <code>useImpressionLog(eventName, extraData)</code> can only send an impression log to the analytics. If your custom Hook API doesn't constrain the use cases and is very abstract, in the long run it's likely to introduce more problems than it solves.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks/#custom-hooks-help-you-migrate-to-better-patterns","title":"Custom Hooks help you migrate to better patterns","text":"<p>Effects are an \"escape hatch\": you use them when you need to \"step outside React\" and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. With time, the React team's goal is to reduce the number of the Effects in your app to the minimum by providing more specific solutions to more specific problems. Wrapping your Effects in custom Hooks makes it easier to upgrade your code when these solutions become available.</p> <p>Let's return to this example:</p> <pre><code>import { useOnlineStatus } from \"./useOnlineStatus.js\";\n\nfunction StatusBar() {\nconst isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\nreturn &lt;h1&gt;{isOnline ? \"\u2705 Online\" : \"\u274c Disconnected\"}&lt;/h1&gt;;\n}\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\nconst isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\nfunction handleSaveClick() {\nconsole.log(\"\u2705 Progress saved\");\n}\n\nreturn (\n&lt;button disabled={!isOnline} on_click={handleSaveClick}&gt;\n{isOnline ? \"Save progress\" : \"Reconnecting...\"}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n);\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;SaveButton /&gt;\n&lt;StatusBar /&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nexport function useOnlineStatus() {\nconst [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nfunction handleOnline() {\nsetIsOnline(true);\n}\nfunction handleOffline() {\nsetIsOnline(false);\n}\nwindow.addEventListener(\"online\", handleOnline);\nwindow.addEventListener(\"offline\", handleOffline);\nreturn () =&gt; {\nwindow.removeEventListener(\"online\", handleOnline);\nwindow.removeEventListener(\"offline\", handleOffline);\n};\n}, []);\nreturn isOnline;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, <code>useOnlineStatus</code> is implemented with a pair of <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>. However, this isn't the best possible solution. There is a number of edge cases it doesn't consider. For example, it assumes that when the component mounts, <code>isOnline</code> is already <code>true</code>, but this may be wrong if the network already went offline. You can use the browser <code>navigator.onLine</code> API to check for that, but using it directly would not work on the server for generating the initial HTML. In short, this code could be improved.</p> <p>Luckily, React 18 includes a dedicated API called <code>useSyncExternalStore</code> which takes care of all of these problems for you.

Instead of keeping the logic in the Effect, you could move most of the imperative logic inside a JavaScript class:</p> <pre><code>import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport { useFadeIn } from \"./useFadeIn.js\";\n\nfunction Welcome() {\nconst ref = useRef(null);\n\nuseFadeIn(ref, 1000);\n\nreturn (\n&lt;h1 className=\"welcome\" ref={ref}&gt;\nWelcome\n&lt;/h1&gt;\n);\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\nconst [show, setShow] = useState(false);\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;button on_click={() =&gt; setShow(!show)}&gt;\n{show ? \"Remove\" : \"Show\"}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n{show &amp;&amp; &lt;Welcome /&gt;}\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { FadeInAnimation } from \"./animation.js\";\n\nexport function useFadeIn(ref, duration) {\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nconst animation = new FadeInAnimation(ref.current);\nanimation.start(duration);\nreturn () =&gt; {\nanimation.stop();\n};\n}, [ref, duration]);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>export class FadeInAnimation {\nconstructor(node) {\nthis.node = node;\n}\nstart(duration) {\nthis.duration = duration;\nthis.onProgress(0);\nthis.startTime = performance.now();\nthis.frameId = requestAnimationFrame(() =&gt; this.onFrame());\n}\nonFrame() {\nconst timePassed = performance.now() - this.startTime;\nconst progress = Math.min(timePassed / this.duration, 1);\nthis.onProgress(progress);\nif (progress === 1) {\nthis.stop();\n} else {\n// We still have more frames to paint\nthis.frameId = requestAnimationFrame(() =&gt; this.onFrame());\n}\n}\nonProgress(progress) {\nthis.node.style.opacity = progress;\n}\nstop() {\ncancelAnimationFrame(this.frameId);\nthis.startTime = null;\nthis.frameId = null;\nthis.duration = 0;\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>label,\nbutton {\ndisplay: block;\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\n}\nhtml,\nbody {\nmin-height: 300px;\n}\n.welcome {\nopacity: 0;\ncolor: white;\npadding: 50px;\ntext-align: center;\nfont-size: 50px;\nbackground-image: radial-gradient(\ncircle,\nrgba(63, 94, 251, 1) 0%,\nrgba(252, 70, 107, 1) 100%\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Effects let you connect React to external systems. The more coordination between Effects is needed (for example, to chain multiple animations), the more it makes sense to extract that logic out of Effects and Hooks completely like in the sandbox above.

This lets your Effects stay simple because they only need to send messages to the system you've moved outside React.</p> <p>The examples above assume that the fade-in logic needs to be written in JavaScript. However, this particular fade-in animation is both simpler and much more efficient to implement with a plain CSS Animation:</p> <pre><code>import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport \"./welcome.css\";\n\nfunction Welcome() {\nreturn &lt;h1 className=\"welcome\"&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\nconst [show, setShow] = useState(false);\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;button on_click={() =&gt; setShow(!show)}&gt;\n{show ? \"Remove\" : \"Show\"}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n{show &amp;&amp; &lt;Welcome /&gt;}\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>label,\nbutton {\ndisplay: block;\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\n}\nhtml,\nbody {\nmin-height: 300px;\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>.welcome {\ncolor: white;\npadding: 50px;\ntext-align: center;\nfont-size: 50px;\nbackground-image: radial-gradient(\ncircle,\nrgba(63, 94, 251, 1) 0%,\nrgba(252, 70, 107, 1) 100%\n);\n\nanimation: fadeIn 1000ms;\n}\n\n@keyframes fadeIn {\n0% {\nopacity: 0;\n}\n100% {\nopacity: 1;\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Sometimes, you don't even need a Hook!</p> <p> <ul> <li>Custom Hooks let you share logic between components.</li> <li>Custom Hooks must be named starting with <code>use</code> followed by a capital letter.</li> <li>Custom Hooks only share stateful logic, not state itself.</li> <li>You can pass reactive values from one Hook to another, and they stay up-to-date.</li> <li>All Hooks re-run every time your component re-renders.</li> <li>The code of your custom Hooks should be pure, like your component's code.</li> <li>Wrap event handlers received by custom Hooks into Effect Events.</li> <li>Don't create custom Hooks like <code>useMount</code>.

However, as your app grows, you might run into another difficulty. Currently, the <code>tasks</code> state and the <code>dispatch</code> function are only available in the top-level <code>TaskApp</code> component. To let other components read the list of tasks or change it, you have to explicitly pass down the current state and the event handlers that change it as props.</p> <p>For example, <code>TaskApp</code> passes a list of tasks and the event handlers to <code>TaskList</code>:</p> <pre><code>&lt;TaskList\ntasks={tasks}\nonChangeTask={handleChangeTask}\nonDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}\n/&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>And <code>TaskList</code> passes the event handlers to <code>Task</code>:</p> <pre><code>&lt;Task task={task} onChange={onChangeTask} onDelete={onDeleteTask} /&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>In a small example like this, this works well, but if you have tens or hundreds of components in the middle, passing down all state and functions can be quite frustrating!</p> <p>This is why, as an alternative to passing them through props, you might want to put both the <code>tasks</code> state and the <code>dispatch</code> function into context.

Now your <code>Page</code> component receives a <code>url</code> prop with the current path. You want to pass the <code>url</code> as a part of your <code>logVisit</code> call, but the dependency linter complains:</p> <pre><code>function Page({ url }) {\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nlogVisit(url);\n}, []); // \ud83d\udd34 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'url'\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Think about what you want the code to do. You want to log a separate visit for different URLs since each URL represents a different page. In other words, this <code>logVisit</code> call should be reactive with respect to the <code>url</code>. This is why, in this case, it makes sense to follow the dependency linter, and add <code>url</code> as a dependency:</p> <pre><code>function Page({ url }) {\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nlogVisit(url);\n}, [url]); // \u2705 All dependencies declared\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's say you want to include the number of items in the shopping cart together with every page visit:</p> <pre><code>function Page({ url }) {\nconst { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);\nconst numberOfItems = items.length;\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nlogVisit(url, numberOfItems);\n}, [url]); // \ud83d\udd34 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'numberOfItems'\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You used <code>numberOfItems</code> inside the Effect, so the linter asks you to add it as a dependency. However, you don't want the <code>logVisit</code> call to be reactive with respect to <code>numberOfItems</code>. If the user puts something into the shopping cart, and the <code>numberOfItems</code> changes, this does not mean that the user visited the page again. In other words, visiting the page is, in some sense, an \"event\". It happens at a precise moment in time.</p> <p>Split the code in two parts:</p> <pre><code>function Page({ url }) {\nconst { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);\nconst numberOfItems = items.length;\n\nconst onVisit = useEffectEvent((visitedUrl) =&gt; {\nlogVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);\n});\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nonVisit(url);\n}, [url]); // \u2705 All dependencies declared\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here, <code>onVisit</code> is an Effect Event. The code inside it isn't reactive. This is why you can use <code>numberOfItems</code> (or any other reactive value!) without worrying that it will cause the surrounding code to re-execute on changes.</p> <p>On the other hand, the Effect itself remains reactive. Code inside the Effect uses the <code>url</code> prop, so the Effect will re-run after every re-render with a different <code>url</code>. This, in turn, will call the <code>onVisit</code> Effect Event.</p> <p>As a result, you will call <code>logVisit</code> for every change to the <code>url</code>, and always read the latest <code>numberOfItems</code>. However, if <code>numberOfItems</code> changes on its own, this will not cause any of the code to re-run.</p> <p> <p>You might be wondering if you could call <code>onVisit()</code> with no arguments, and read the <code>url</code> inside it:</p> <pre><code>const onVisit = useEffectEvent(() =&gt; {\nlogVisit(url, numberOfItems);\n});\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nonVisit();\n}, [url]);\n</code></pre> <p>This would work, but it's better to pass this <code>url</code> to the Effect Event explicitly. By passing <code>url</code> as an argument to your Effect Event, you are saying that visiting a page with a different <code>url</code> constitutes a separate \"event\" from the user's perspective. The <code>visitedUrl</code> is a part of the \"event\" that happened:</p> <pre><code>const onVisit = useEffectEvent((visitedUrl) =&gt; {\nlogVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);\n});\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nonVisit(url);\n}, [url]);\n</code></pre> <p>Since your Effect Event explicitly \"asks\" for the <code>visitedUrl</code>, now you can't accidentally remove <code>url</code> from the Effect's dependencies. If you remove the <code>url</code> dependency (causing distinct page visits to be counted as one), the linter will warn you about it. You want <code>onVisit</code> to be reactive with regards to the <code>url</code>, so instead of reading the <code>url</code> inside (where it wouldn't be reactive), you pass it from your Effect.</p> <p>This becomes especially important if there is some asynchronous logic inside the Effect:</p> <pre><code>const onVisit = useEffectEvent((visitedUrl) =&gt; {\nlogVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);\n});\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; {\nonVisit(url);\n}, 5000); // Delay logging visits\n}, [url]);\n</code></pre> <p>Here, <code>url</code> inside <code>onVisit</code> corresponds to the latest <code>url</code> (which could have already changed), but <code>visitedUrl</code> corresponds to the <code>url</code> that originally caused this Effect (and this <code>onVisit</code> call) to run.</p> <p></p> <p>"},{"location":"learn/separating-events-from-effects/#is-it-okay-to-suppress-the-dependency-linter-instead","title":"Is it okay to suppress the dependency linter instead?","text":"<p>In the existing codebases, you may sometimes see the lint rule suppressed like this:</p> <pre><code>function Page({ url }) {\nconst { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);\nconst numberOfItems = items.length;\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nlogVisit(url, numberOfItems);\n// \ud83d\udd34 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:\n// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\n}, [url]);\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>After <code>useEffectEvent</code> becomes a stable part of React, we recommend never suppressing the linter.</p> <p>The first downside of suppressing the rule is that React will no longer warn you when your Effect needs to \"react\" to a new reactive dependency you've introduced to your code.

You will no longer get such reminders for any future edits to that Effect if you disable the linter. This leads to bugs.</p> <p>Here is an example of a confusing bug caused by suppressing the linter. In this example, the <code>handleMove</code> function is supposed to read the current <code>canMove</code> state variable value in order to decide whether the dot should follow the cursor.

If you remove the suppression, you'll see that this Effect should depend on the <code>handleMove</code> function. This makes sense: <code>handleMove</code> is declared inside the component body, which makes it a reactive value. Every reactive value must be specified as a dependency, or it can potentially get stale over time!</p> <p>The author of the original code has \"lied\" to React by saying that the Effect does not depend (<code>[]</code>) on any reactive values. This is why React did not re-synchronize the Effect after <code>canMove</code> has changed (and <code>handleMove</code> with it). Because React did not re-synchronize the Effect, the <code>handleMove</code> attached as a listener is the <code>handleMove</code> function created during the initial render.

It may feel \"more descriptive\" at first but it obscures your intent. As a rule of thumb, Effect Events should correspond to something that happens from the user's perspective. For example, <code>onMessage</code>, <code>onTick</code>, <code>onVisit</code>, or <code>onConnected</code> are good Effect Event names. Code inside them would likely not need to be reactive. On the other hand, <code>onMount</code>, <code>onUpdate</code>, <code>onUnmount</code>, or <code>onAfterRender</code> are so generic that it's easy to accidentally put code that should be reactive into them. This is why you should name your Effect Events after what the user thinks has happened, not when some code happened to run.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"learn/separating-events-from-effects/#fix-a-delayed-notification","title":"Fix a delayed notification","text":"<p>When you join a chat room, this component shows a notification.

However, if you're building a new app or a site fully with React, we recommend using a framework.</p> <p>Here's why.</p> <p>Even if you don't need routing or data fetching at first, you'll likely want to add some libraries for them. As your JavaScript bundle grows with every new feature, you might have to figure out how to split code for every route individually. As your data fetching needs get more complex, you are likely to encounter server-client network waterfalls that make your app feel very slow. As your audience includes more users with poor network conditions and low-end devices, you might need to generate HTML from your components to display content early--either on the server, or during the build time. Changing your setup to run some of your code on the server or during the build can be very tricky.</p> <p>These problems are not React-specific. This is why Svelte has SvelteKit, Vue has Nuxt, and so on. To solve these problems on your own, you'll need to integrate your bundler with your router and with your data fetching library. It's not hard to get an initial setup working, but there are a lot of subtleties involved in making an app that loads quickly even as it grows over time. You'll want to send down the minimal amount of app code but do so in a single client\u2013server roundtrip, in parallel with any data required for the page. You'll likely want the page to be interactive before your JavaScript code even runs, to support progressive enhancement. You may want to generate a folder of fully static HTML files for your marketing pages that can be hosted anywhere and still work with JavaScript disabled. Building these capabilities yourself takes real work.</p> <p>React frameworks on this page solve problems like these by default, with no extra work from your side. They let you start very lean and then scale your app with your needs. Each React framework has a community, so finding answers to questions and upgrading tooling is easier. Frameworks also give structure to your code, helping you and others retain context and skills between different projects. Conversely, with a custom setup it's easier to get stuck on unsupported dependency versions, and you'll essentially end up creating your own framework\u2014albeit one with no community or upgrade path (and if it's anything like the ones we've made in the past, more haphazardly designed).</p> <p>If you're still not convinced, or your app has unusual constraints not served well by these frameworks and you'd like to roll your own custom setup, we can't stop you--go for it!

There is no \"identifier\" that is passed to <code>useState</code>, so how does it know which of the state variables to return? Does it rely on some magic like parsing your functions? The answer is no.</p> <p>Instead, to enable their concise syntax, Hooks rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component. This works well in practice because if you follow the rule above (\"only call Hooks at the top level\"), Hooks will always be called in the same order. Additionally, a linter plugin catches most mistakes.</p> <p>Internally, React holds an array of state pairs for every component.

State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it's \"local\" to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two <code>&lt;Gallery /&gt;</code> components, so their state is stored separately.</p> <p>Also notice how the <code>Page</code> component doesn't \"know\" anything about the <code>Gallery</code> state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, state is fully private to the component declaring it. The parent component can't change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.</p> <p>What if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to remove state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in Sharing State Between Components.</p> <p> <ul> <li>Use a state variable when a component needs to \"remember\" some information between renders.</li> <li>State variables are declared by calling the <code>useState</code> Hook.</li> <li>Hooks are special functions that start with <code>use</code>. They let you \"hook into\" React features like state.</li> <li>Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including <code>useState</code>, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.</li> <li>The <code>useState</code> Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it.</li> <li>You can have more than one state variable.

It includes logic like event handlers that specify what happens in response to inputs. React updates the screen to match this snapshot and connects the event handlers.

State actually \"lives\" in React itself--as if on a shelf!--outside of your function. When React calls your component, it gives you a snapshot of the state for that particular render. Your component returns a snapshot of the UI with a fresh set of props and event handlers in its JSX, all calculated using the state values from that render!</p> <p> </p> <p>Here's a little experiment to show you how this works.

During the first render, <code>number</code> was <code>0</code>. This is why, in that render's <code>on_click</code> handler, the value of <code>number</code> is still <code>0</code> even after <code>setNumber(number + 1)</code> was called:</p> <pre><code>&lt;button\non_click={() =&gt; {\nsetNumber(number + 1);\nsetNumber(number + 1);\nsetNumber(number + 1);\n}}\n&gt;\n+3\n&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Here is what this button's click handler tells React to do:</p> <ol> <li><code>setNumber(number + 1)</code>: <code>number</code> is <code>0</code> so <code>setNumber(0 + 1)</code>.<ul> <li>React prepares to change <code>number</code> to <code>1</code> on the next render.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>setNumber(number + 1)</code>: <code>number</code> is <code>0</code> so <code>setNumber(0 + 1)</code>.<ul> <li>React prepares to change <code>number</code> to <code>1</code> on the next render.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>setNumber(number + 1)</code>: <code>number</code> is <code>0</code> so <code>setNumber(0 + 1)</code>.<ul> <li>React prepares to change <code>number</code> to <code>1</code> on the next render.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Even though you called <code>setNumber(number + 1)</code> three times, in this render's event handler <code>number</code> is always <code>0</code>, so you set the state to <code>1</code> three times. This is why, after your event handler finishes, React re-renders the component with <code>number</code> equal to <code>1</code> rather than <code>3</code>.</p> <p>You can also visualize this by mentally substituting state variables with their values in your code. Since the <code>number</code> state variable is <code>0</code> for this render, its event handler looks like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;button\non_click={() =&gt; {\nsetNumber(0 + 1);\nsetNumber(0 + 1);\nsetNumber(0 + 1);\n}}\n&gt;\n+3\n&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>For the next render, <code>number</code> is <code>1</code>, so that render's click handler looks like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;button\non_click={() =&gt; {\nsetNumber(1 + 1);\nsetNumber(1 + 1);\nsetNumber(1 + 1);\n}}\n&gt;\n+3\n&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This is why clicking the button again will set the counter to <code>2</code>, then to <code>3</code> on the next click, and so on.</p>"},{"location":"learn/state-as-a-snapshot/#state-over-time","title":"State over time","text":"<p>Well, that was fun.

Like a math formula, it should only calculate the result, but not do anything else.</p> </li> <li> <p>Event handlers (introduced in Adding Interactivity) are nested functions inside your components that do things rather than just calculate them. An event handler might update an input field, submit an HTTP POST request to buy a product, or navigate the user to another screen. Event handlers contain \"side effects\" (they change the program's state) caused by a specific user action (for example, a button click or typing).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Sometimes this isn't enough. Consider a <code>ChatRoom</code> component that must connect to the chat server whenever it's visible on the screen. Connecting to a server is not a pure calculation (it's a side effect) so it can't happen during rendering. However, there is no single particular event like a click that causes <code>ChatRoom</code> to be displayed.</p> <p>Effects let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event. Sending a message in the chat is an event because it is directly caused by the user clicking a specific button. However, setting up a server connection is an Effect because it should happen no matter which interaction caused the component to appear. Effects run at the end of a commit after the screen updates. This is a good time to synchronize the React components with some external system (like network or a third-party library).</p> <p> <p>Here and later in this text, capitalized \"Effect\" refers to the React-specific definition above, i.e. a side effect caused by rendering.

In other words, <code>useEffect</code> \"delays\" a piece of code from running until that render is reflected on the screen.</p> <p>Let's see how you can use an Effect to synchronize with an external system. Consider a <code>&lt;VideoPlayer&gt;</code> React component. It would be nice to control whether it's playing or paused by passing an <code>isPlaying</code> prop to it:</p> <pre><code>&lt;VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} /&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Your custom <code>VideoPlayer</code> component renders the built-in browser <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag:</p> <pre><code>function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\n// TODO: do something with isPlaying\nreturn &lt;video src={src} /&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>However, the browser <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag does not have an <code>isPlaying</code> prop. The only way to control it is to manually call the <code>play()</code> and <code>pause()</code> methods on the DOM element. You need to synchronize the value of <code>isPlaying</code> prop, which tells whether the video should currently be playing, with calls like <code>play()</code> and <code>pause()</code>.</p> <p>We'll need to first get a ref to the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> DOM node.</p> <p>You might be tempted to try to call <code>play()</code> or <code>pause()</code> during rendering, but that isn't correct:</p> <pre><code>import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\nconst ref = useRef(null);\n\nif (isPlaying) {\nref.current.play(); // Calling these while rendering isn't allowed.\n} else {\nref.current.pause(); // Also, this crashes.\n}\n\nreturn &lt;video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline /&gt;;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\nconst [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;button on_click={() =&gt; setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}&gt;\n{isPlaying ? \"Pause\" : \"Play\"}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;VideoPlayer\nisPlaying={isPlaying}\nsrc=\"https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4\"\n/&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>button {\ndisplay: block;\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\n}\nvideo {\nwidth: 250px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The reason this code isn't correct is that it tries to do something with the DOM node during rendering. In React, rendering should be a pure calculation of JSX and should not contain side effects like modifying the DOM.</p> <p>Moreover, when <code>VideoPlayer</code> is called for the first time, its DOM does not exist yet! There isn't a DOM node yet to call <code>play()</code> or <code>pause()</code> on, because React doesn't know what DOM to create until you return the JSX.</p> <p>The solution here is to wrap the side effect with <code>useEffect</code> to move it out of the rendering calculation:</p> <pre><code>import { useEffect, useRef } from \"react\";\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\nconst ref = useRef(null);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nif (isPlaying) {\nref.current.play();\n} else {\nref.current.pause();\n}\n});\n\nreturn &lt;video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline /&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>By wrapping the DOM update in an Effect, you let React update the screen first. Then your Effect runs.</p> <p>When your <code>VideoPlayer</code> component renders (either the first time or if it re-renders), a few things will happen. First, React will update the screen, ensuring the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag is in the DOM with the right props. Then React will run your Effect. Finally, your Effect will call <code>play()</code> or <code>pause()</code> depending on the value of <code>isPlaying</code>.</p> <p>Press Play/Pause multiple times and see how the video player stays synchronized to the <code>isPlaying</code> value:</p> <pre><code>import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\nconst ref = useRef(null);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nif (isPlaying) {\nref.current.play();\n} else {\nref.current.pause();\n}\n});\n\nreturn &lt;video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline /&gt;;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\nconst [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;button on_click={() =&gt; setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}&gt;\n{isPlaying ? \"Pause\" : \"Play\"}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;VideoPlayer\nisPlaying={isPlaying}\nsrc=\"https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4\"\n/&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>button {\ndisplay: block;\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\n}\nvideo {\nwidth: 250px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the \"external system\" you synchronized to React state was the browser media API. You can use a similar approach to wrap legacy non-React code (like jQuery plugins) into declarative React components.</p> <p>Note that controlling a video player is much more complex in practice. Calling <code>play()</code> may fail, the user might play or pause using the built-in browser controls, and so on. This example is very simplified and incomplete.</p> <p> <p>By default, Effects run after every render. This is why code like this will produce an infinite loop:</p> <pre><code>const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nsetCount(count + 1);\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Effects run as a result of rendering. Setting state triggers rendering. Setting state immediately in an Effect is like plugging a power outlet into itself. The Effect runs, it sets the state, which causes a re-render, which causes the Effect to run, it sets the state again, this causes another re-render, and so on.</p> <p>Effects should usually synchronize your components with an external system. If there's no external system and you only want to adjust some state based on other state, you might not need an Effect.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"learn/synchronizing-with-effects/#step-2-specify-the-effect-dependencies","title":"Step 2: Specify the Effect dependencies","text":"<p>By default, Effects run after every render.

Notice how typing causes the Effect to re-run:</p> <pre><code>import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\nconst ref = useRef(null);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nif (isPlaying) {\nconsole.log(\"Calling video.play()\");\nref.current.play();\n} else {\nconsole.log(\"Calling video.pause()\");\nref.current.pause();\n}\n});\n\nreturn &lt;video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline /&gt;;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\nconst [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);\nconst [text, setText] = useState(\"\");\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;input value={text} onChange={(e) =&gt; setText(e.target.value)} /&gt;\n&lt;button on_click={() =&gt; setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}&gt;\n{isPlaying ? \"Pause\" : \"Play\"}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;VideoPlayer\nisPlaying={isPlaying}\nsrc=\"https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4\"\n/&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>input,\nbutton {\ndisplay: block;\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\n}\nvideo {\nwidth: 250px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You can tell React to skip unnecessarily re-running the Effect by specifying an array of dependencies as the second argument to the <code>useEffect</code> call. Start by adding an empty <code>[]</code> array to the above example on line 14:</p> <pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {\n// ...\n}, []);\n</code></pre> <p>You should see an error saying <code>React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'isPlaying'</code>:</p> <pre><code>import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\nconst ref = useRef(null);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nif (isPlaying) {\nconsole.log(\"Calling video.play()\");\nref.current.play();\n} else {\nconsole.log(\"Calling video.pause()\");\nref.current.pause();\n}\n}, []); // This causes an error\n\nreturn &lt;video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline /&gt;;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\nconst [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);\nconst [text, setText] = useState(\"\");\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;input value={text} onChange={(e) =&gt; setText(e.target.value)} /&gt;\n&lt;button on_click={() =&gt; setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}&gt;\n{isPlaying ? \"Pause\" : \"Play\"}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;VideoPlayer\nisPlaying={isPlaying}\nsrc=\"https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4\"\n/&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>input,\nbutton {\ndisplay: block;\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\n}\nvideo {\nwidth: 250px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The problem is that the code inside of your Effect depends on the <code>isPlaying</code> prop to decide what to do, but this dependency was not explicitly declared. To fix this issue, add <code>isPlaying</code> to the dependency array:</p> <pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {\nif (isPlaying) {\n// It's used here...\n// ...\n} else {\n// ...\n}\n}, [isPlaying]); // ...so it must be declared here!\n</code></pre> <p>Now all dependencies are declared, so there is no error. Specifying <code>[isPlaying]</code> as the dependency array tells React that it should skip re-running your Effect if <code>isPlaying</code> is the same as it was during the previous render. With this change, typing into the input doesn't cause the Effect to re-run, but pressing Play/Pause does:</p> <pre><code>import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\nconst ref = useRef(null);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nif (isPlaying) {\nconsole.log(\"Calling video.play()\");\nref.current.play();\n} else {\nconsole.log(\"Calling video.pause()\");\nref.current.pause();\n}\n}, [isPlaying]);\n\nreturn &lt;video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline /&gt;;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\nconst [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);\nconst [text, setText] = useState(\"\");\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;input value={text} onChange={(e) =&gt; setText(e.target.value)} /&gt;\n&lt;button on_click={() =&gt; setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}&gt;\n{isPlaying ? \"Pause\" : \"Play\"}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;VideoPlayer\nisPlaying={isPlaying}\nsrc=\"https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4\"\n/&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>input,\nbutton {\ndisplay: block;\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\n}\nvideo {\nwidth: 250px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The dependency array can contain multiple dependencies. React will only skip re-running the Effect if all of the dependencies you specify have exactly the same values as they had during the previous render. React compares the dependency values using the <code>Object.is</code> comparison. See the <code>useEffect</code> reference for details.</p> <p>Notice that you can't \"choose\" your dependencies. You will get a lint error if the dependencies you specified don't match what React expects based on the code inside your Effect. This helps catch many bugs in your code. If you don't want some code to re-run, edit the Effect code itself to not \"need\" that dependency.</p> <p> <p>The behaviors without the dependency array and with an empty <code>[]</code> dependency array are different:</p> <pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {\n// This runs after every render\n});\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\n// This runs only on mount (when the component appears)\n}, []);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\n// This runs on mount *and also* if either a or b have changed since the last render\n}, [a, b]);\n</code></pre> <p>We'll take a close look at what \"mount\" means in the next step.</p> <p></p> <p>"},{"location":"learn/synchronizing-with-effects/#why-was-the-ref-omitted-from-the-dependency-array","title":"Why was the ref omitted from the dependency array?","text":"<p>This Effect uses both <code>ref</code> and <code>isPlaying</code>, but only <code>isPlaying</code> is declared as a dependency:</p> <pre><code>function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\nconst ref = useRef(null);\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nif (isPlaying) {\nref.current.play();\n} else {\nref.current.pause();\n}\n}, [isPlaying]);\n</code></pre> <p>This is because the <code>ref</code> object has a stable identity: React guarantees you'll always get the same object from the same <code>useRef</code> call on every render. It never changes, so it will never by itself cause the Effect to re-run. Therefore, it does not matter whether you include it or not. Including it is fine too:</p> <pre><code>function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\nconst ref = useRef(null);\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nif (isPlaying) {\nref.current.play();\n} else {\nref.current.pause();\n}\n}, [isPlaying, ref]);\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>set</code> functions returned by <code>useState</code> also have stable identity, so you will often see them omitted from the dependencies too. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do.</p> <p>Omitting always-stable dependencies only works when the linter can \"see\" that the object is stable. For example, if <code>ref</code> was passed from a parent component, you would have to specify it in the dependency array.

The component mounts and calls <code>connection.connect()</code>. Then imagine the user navigates to another screen--for example, to the Settings page. The <code>ChatRoom</code> component unmounts. Finally, the user clicks Back and <code>ChatRoom</code> mounts again. This would set up a second connection--but the first connection was never destroyed! As the user navigates across the app, the connections would keep piling up.</p> <p>Bugs like this are easy to miss without extensive manual testing. To help you spot them quickly, in development React remounts every component once immediately after its initial mount.</p> <p>Seeing the <code>\"\u2705 Connecting...\"</code> log twice helps you notice the real issue: your code doesn't close the connection when the component unmounts.</p> <p>To fix the issue, return a cleanup function from your Effect:</p> <pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {\nconst connection = createConnection();\nconnection.connect();\nreturn () =&gt; {\nconnection.disconnect();\n};\n}, []);\n</code></pre> <p>React will call your cleanup function each time before the Effect runs again, and one final time when the component unmounts (gets removed).

By remounting your component, React verifies that navigating away and back would not break your code. Disconnecting and then connecting again is exactly what should happen! When you implement the cleanup well, there should be no user-visible difference between running the Effect once vs running it, cleaning it up, and running it again.

If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.</li> <li>CSS--consider what you would make class selectors for. (However, components are a bit less granular.)</li> <li>Design--consider how you would organize the design's layers.</li> </ul> <p>If your JSON is well-structured, you'll often find that it naturally maps to the component structure of your UI. That's because UI and data models often have the same information architecture--that is, the same shape. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.</p> <p>There are five components on this screen:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li><code>filterable_product_table</code> (grey) contains the entire app.</li> <li><code>search_bar</code> (blue) receives the user input.</li> <li><code>product_table</code> (lavender) displays and filters the list according to the user input.</li> <li><code>product_category_row</code> (green) displays a heading for each category.</li> <li><code>product_row</code> (yellow) displays a row for each product.</li> </ol> <p>If you look at <code>product_table</code> (lavender), you'll see that the table header (containing the \"Name\" and \"Price\" labels) isn't its own component. This is a matter of preference, and you could go either way. For this example, it is a part of <code>product_table</code> because it appears inside the <code>product_table</code>'s list. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if you add sorting), you can move it into its own <code>product_table_header</code> component.</p> <p>Now that you've identified the components in the mockup, arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mockup should appear as a child in the hierarchy:</p> <ul> <li><code>filterable_product_table</code><ul> <li><code>search_bar</code></li> <li><code>product_table</code><ul> <li><code>product_category_row</code></li> <li><code>product_row</code></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"learn/thinking-in-react/#step-2-build-a-static-version-in-react","title":"Step 2: Build a static version in React","text":"<p>Now that you have your component hierarchy, it's time to implement your app. The most straightforward approach is to build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity... yet!

Building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, but adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.</p> <p>To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you'll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. Props are a way of passing data from parent to child. (If you're familiar with the concept of state, don't use state at all to build this static version.

You will use state for this.</p> <p>Think of state as the minimal set of changing data that your app needs to remember. The most important principle for structuring state is to keep it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else on-demand. For example, if you're building a shopping list, you can store the items as an array in state. If you want to also display the number of items in the list, don't store the number of items as another state value--instead, read the length of your array.</p> <p>Now think of all of the pieces of data in this example application:</p> <ol> <li>The original list of products</li> <li>The search text the user has entered</li> <li>The value of the checkbox</li> <li>The filtered list of products</li> </ol> <p>Which of these are state? Identify the ones that are not:</p> <ul> <li>Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn't state.</li> <li>Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn't state.</li> <li>Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn't state!</li> </ul> <p>What's left is probably state.</p> <p>Let's go through them one by one again:</p> <ol> <li>The original list of products is passed in as props, so it's not state.</li> <li>The search text seems to be state since it changes over time and can't be computed from anything.</li> <li>The value of the checkbox seems to be state since it changes over time and can't be computed from anything.</li> <li>The filtered list of products isn't state because it can be computed by taking the original list of products and filtering it according to the search text and value of the checkbox.</li> </ol> <p>This means only the search text and the value of the checkbox are state! Nicely done!</p> <p>Deep Dive</p> <p>Props vs State</p> <p>There are two types of \"model\" data in React: props and state. The two are very different:</p> <ul> <li>Props are like arguments you pass to a function. They let a parent component pass data to a child component and customize its appearance. For example, a <code>html.form</code> can pass a <code>color</code> prop to a <code>html.button</code>.</li> <li>State is like a component\u2019s memory. It lets a component keep track of some information and change it in response to interactions. For example, a <code>html.button</code> might keep track of <code>is_hovered</code> state.</li> </ul> <p>Props and state are different, but they work together. A parent component will often keep some information in state (so that it can change it), and pass it down to child components as their props. It's okay if the difference still feels fuzzy on the first read. It takes a bit of practice for it to really stick!</p>"},{"location":"learn/thinking-in-react/#step-4-identify-where-your-state-should-live","title":"Step 4: Identify where your state should live","text":"<p>After identifying your app\u2019s minimal state data, you need to identify which component is responsible for changing this state, or owns the state. Remember: React uses one-way data flow, passing data down the component hierarchy from parent to child component. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. This can be challenging if you\u2019re new to this concept, but you can figure it out by following these steps!</p> <p>For each piece of state in your application:</p> <ol> <li>Identify every component that renders something based on that state.</li> <li>Find their closest common parent component\u2014a component above them all in the hierarchy.</li> <li>Decide where the state should live:<ol> <li>Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent.</li> <li>You can also put the state into some component above their common parent.</li> <li>If you can't find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>In the previous step, you found two pieces of state in this application: the search input text, and the value of the checkbox. In this example, they always appear together, so it makes sense to put them into the same place.</p> <p>Now let's run through our strategy for them:</p> <ol> <li>Identify components that use state:<ul> <li><code>product_table</code> needs to filter the product list based on that state (search text and checkbox value).</li> <li><code>search_bar</code> needs to display that state (search text and checkbox value).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Find their common parent: The first parent component both components share is <code>filterable_product_table</code>.</li> <li>Decide where the state lives: We'll keep the filter text and checked state values in <code>filterable_product_table</code>.</li> </ol> <p>So the state values will live in <code>filterable_product_table</code>.</p> <p>Add state to the component with the <code>use_state()</code> Hook. Hooks are special functions that let you \"hook into\" React. Add two state variables at the top of <code>filterable_product_table</code> and specify their initial state:</p> <pre><code>@component\ndef filterable_product_table(products):\n    filter_text, set_filter_text = use_state(\"\")\n    in_stock_only, set_in_stock_only = use_state(False)\n</code></pre> <p>Then, pass <code>filter_text</code> and <code>in_stock_only</code> to <code>product_table</code> and <code>search_bar</code> as props:</p> <pre><code>html.div(\n    search_bar(filter_text=filter_text, in_stock_only=in_stock_only),\n    product_table(products=products, filter_text=filter_text, in_stock_only=in_stock_only),\n)\n</code></pre> <p>You can start seeing how your application will behave.

With how you've built the board so far you would need to copy-paste the code that updates the square nine times (once for each square you have)! Instead of copy-pasting, React's component architecture allows you to create a reusable component to avoid messy, duplicated code.</p> <p>First, you are going to copy the line defining your first square (<code>&lt;button className=\"square\"&gt;1&lt;/button&gt;</code>) from your <code>Board</code> component into a new <code>Square</code> component:</p> <pre><code>function Square() {\nreturn &lt;button className=\"square\"&gt;1&lt;/button&gt;;\n}\n\nexport default function Board() {\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Then you'll update the Board component to render that <code>Square</code> component using JSX syntax:</p> <pre><code>// ...\nexport default function Board() {\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note how unlike the browser <code>div</code>s, your own components <code>Board</code> and <code>Square</code> must start with a capital letter.</p> <p>Let's take a look:</p> <p></p> <p>Oh no! You lost the numbered squares you had before. Now each square says \"1\". To fix this, you will use props to pass the value each square should have from the parent component (<code>Board</code>) to its child (<code>Square</code>).</p> <p>Update the <code>Square</code> component to read the <code>value</code> prop that you'll pass from the <code>Board</code>:</p> <pre><code>function Square({ value }) {\nreturn &lt;button className=\"square\"&gt;1&lt;/button&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>function Square({ value })</code> indicates the Square component can be passed a prop called <code>value</code>.</p> <p>Now you want to display that <code>value</code> instead of <code>1</code> inside every square. Try doing it like this:</p> <pre><code>function Square({ value }) {\nreturn &lt;button className=\"square\"&gt;value&lt;/button&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Oops, this is not what you wanted:</p> <p></p> <p>You wanted to render the JavaScript variable called <code>value</code> from your component, not the word \"value\". To \"escape into JavaScript\" from JSX, you need curly braces. Add curly braces around <code>value</code> in JSX like so:</p> <pre><code>function Square({ value }) {\nreturn &lt;button className=\"square\"&gt;{value}&lt;/button&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For now, you should see an empty board:</p> <p></p> <p>This is because the <code>Board</code> component hasn't passed the <code>value</code> prop to each <code>Square</code> component it renders yet. To fix it you'll add the <code>value</code> prop to each <code>Square</code> component rendered by the <code>Board</code> component:</p> <pre><code>export default function Board() {\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"1\" /&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"2\" /&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"3\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"4\" /&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"5\" /&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"6\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"7\" /&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"8\" /&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"9\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now you should see a grid of numbers again:</p> <p></p> <p>Your updated code should look like this:</p> <pre><code>function Square({ value }) {\nreturn &lt;button className=\"square\"&gt;{value}&lt;/button&gt;;\n}\n\nexport default function Board() {\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"1\" /&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"2\" /&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"3\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"4\" /&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"5\" /&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"6\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"7\" /&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"8\" /&gt;\n&lt;Square value=\"9\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>* {\nbox-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\nbody {\nfont-family: sans-serif;\nmargin: 20px;\npadding: 0;\n}\n\n.square {\nbackground: #fff;\nborder: 1px solid #999;\nfloat: left;\nfont-size: 24px;\nfont-weight: bold;\nline-height: 34px;\nheight: 34px;\nmargin-right: -1px;\nmargin-top: -1px;\npadding: 0;\ntext-align: center;\nwidth: 34px;\n}\n\n.board-row:after {\nclear: both;\ncontent: \"\";\ndisplay: table;\n}\n\n.status {\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n.game {\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: row;\n}\n\n.game-info {\nmargin-left: 20px;\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe/#making-an-interactive-component","title":"Making an interactive component","text":"<p>Let's fill the <code>Square</code> component with an <code>X</code> when you click it. Declare a function called <code>handleClick</code> inside of the <code>Square</code>. Then, add <code>on_click</code> to the props of the button JSX element returned from the <code>Square</code>:</p> <pre><code>function Square({ value }) {\nfunction handleClick() {\nconsole.log(\"clicked!\");\n}\n\nreturn (\n&lt;button className=\"square\" on_click={handleClick}&gt;\n{value}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>If you click on a square now, you should see a log saying <code>\"clicked!\"</code> in the Console tab at the bottom of the Browser section in CodeSandbox. Clicking the square more than once will log <code>\"clicked!\"</code> again. Repeated console logs with the same message will not create more lines in the console. Instead, you will see an incrementing counter next to your first <code>\"clicked!\"</code> log.</p> <p> <p>If you are following this tutorial using your local development environment, you need to open your browser's Console. For example, if you use the Chrome browser, you can view the Console with the keyboard shortcut Shift + Ctrl + J (on Windows/Linux) or Option + \u2318 + J (on macOS).</p> <p></p> <p>As a next step, you want the Square component to \"remember\" that it got clicked, and fill it with an \"X\" mark. To \"remember\" things, components use state.</p> <p>React provides a special function called <code>useState</code> that you can call from your component to let it \"remember\" things. Let's store the current value of the <code>Square</code> in state, and change it when the <code>Square</code> is clicked.</p> <p>Import <code>useState</code> at the top of the file. Remove the <code>value</code> prop from the <code>Square</code> component. Instead, add a new line at the start of the <code>Square</code> that calls <code>useState</code>. Have it return a state variable called <code>value</code>:</p> <pre><code>import { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Square() {\nconst [value, setValue] = useState(null);\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n//...\n</code></pre> <p><code>value</code> stores the value and <code>setValue</code> is a function that can be used to change the value. The <code>null</code> passed to <code>useState</code> is used as the initial value for this state variable, so <code>value</code> here starts off equal to <code>null</code>.</p> <p>Since the <code>Square</code> component no longer accepts props anymore, you'll remove the <code>value</code> prop from all nine of the Square components created by the Board component:</p> <pre><code>// ...\nexport default function Board() {\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now you'll change <code>Square</code> to display an \"X\" when clicked. Replace the <code>console.log(\"clicked!\");</code> event handler with <code>setValue('X');</code>. Now your <code>Square</code> component looks like this:</p> <pre><code>function Square() {\nconst [value, setValue] = useState(null);\n\nfunction handleClick() {\nsetValue(\"X\");\n}\n\nreturn (\n&lt;button className=\"square\" on_click={handleClick}&gt;\n{value}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>By calling this <code>set</code> function from an <code>on_click</code> handler, you're telling React to re-render that <code>Square</code> whenever its <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> is clicked. After the update, the <code>Square</code>'s <code>value</code> will be <code>'X'</code>, so you'll see the \"X\" on the game board. Click on any Square, and \"X\" should show up:</p> <p></p> <p>Each Square has its own state: the <code>value</code> stored in each Square is completely independent of the others. When you call a <code>set</code> function in a component, React automatically updates the child components inside too.</p> <p>After you've made the above changes, your code will look like this:</p> <pre><code>import { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Square() {\nconst [value, setValue] = useState(null);\n\nfunction handleClick() {\nsetValue(\"X\");\n}\n\nreturn (\n&lt;button className=\"square\" on_click={handleClick}&gt;\n{value}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n);\n}\n\nexport default function Board() {\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;Square /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>* {\nbox-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\nbody {\nfont-family: sans-serif;\nmargin: 20px;\npadding: 0;\n}\n\n.square {\nbackground: #fff;\nborder: 1px solid #999;\nfloat: left;\nfont-size: 24px;\nfont-weight: bold;\nline-height: 34px;\nheight: 34px;\nmargin-right: -1px;\nmargin-top: -1px;\npadding: 0;\ntext-align: center;\nwidth: 34px;\n}\n\n.board-row:after {\nclear: both;\ncontent: \"\";\ndisplay: table;\n}\n\n.status {\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n.game {\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: row;\n}\n\n.game-info {\nmargin-left: 20px;\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe/#react-developer-tools","title":"React Developer Tools","text":"<p>React DevTools let you check the props and the state of your React components.

To check for a winner in a tic-tac-toe game, the <code>Board</code> would need to somehow know the state of each of the 9 <code>Square</code> components.</p> <p>How would you approach that? At first, you might guess that the <code>Board</code> needs to \"ask\" each <code>Square</code> for that <code>Square</code>'s state. Although this approach is technically possible in React, we discourage it because the code becomes difficult to understand, susceptible to bugs, and hard to refactor. Instead, the best approach is to store the game's state in the parent <code>Board</code> component instead of in each <code>Square</code>. The <code>Board</code> component can tell each <code>Square</code> what to display by passing a prop, like you did when you passed a number to each Square.</p> <p>To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, declare the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass that state back down to the children via props. This keeps the child components in sync with each other and with their parent.</p> <p>Lifting state into a parent component is common when React components are refactored.</p> <p>Let's take this opportunity to try it out. Edit the <code>Board</code> component so that it declares a state variable named <code>squares</code> that defaults to an array of 9 nulls corresponding to the 9 squares:</p> <pre><code>// ...\nexport default function Board() {\nconst [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\nreturn (\n// ...\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>Array(9).fill(null)</code> creates an array with nine elements and sets each of them to <code>null</code>. The <code>useState()</code> call around it declares a <code>squares</code> state variable that's initially set to that array. Each entry in the array corresponds to the value of a square. When you fill the board in later, the <code>squares</code> array will look like this:</p> <pre><code>[\"O\", null, \"X\", \"X\", \"X\", \"O\", \"O\", null, null];\n</code></pre> <p>Now your <code>Board</code> component needs to pass the <code>value</code> prop down to each <code>Square</code> that it renders:</p> <pre><code>export default function Board() {\nconst [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[0]} /&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[1]} /&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[2]} /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[3]} /&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[4]} /&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[5]} /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[6]} /&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[7]} /&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[8]} /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Next, you'll edit the <code>Square</code> component to receive the <code>value</code> prop from the Board component. This will require removing the Square component's own stateful tracking of <code>value</code> and the button's <code>on_click</code> prop:</p> <pre><code>function Square({ value }) {\nreturn &lt;button className=\"square\"&gt;{value}&lt;/button&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>At this point you should see an empty tic-tac-toe board:</p> <p></p> <p>And your code should look like this:</p> <pre><code>import { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Square({ value }) {\nreturn &lt;button className=\"square\"&gt;{value}&lt;/button&gt;;\n}\n\nexport default function Board() {\nconst [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[0]} /&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[1]} /&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[2]} /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[3]} /&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[4]} /&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[5]} /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[6]} /&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[7]} /&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[8]} /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>* {\nbox-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\nbody {\nfont-family: sans-serif;\nmargin: 20px;\npadding: 0;\n}\n\n.square {\nbackground: #fff;\nborder: 1px solid #999;\nfloat: left;\nfont-size: 24px;\nfont-weight: bold;\nline-height: 34px;\nheight: 34px;\nmargin-right: -1px;\nmargin-top: -1px;\npadding: 0;\ntext-align: center;\nwidth: 34px;\n}\n\n.board-row:after {\nclear: both;\ncontent: \"\";\ndisplay: table;\n}\n\n.status {\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n.game {\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: row;\n}\n\n.game-info {\nmargin-left: 20px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Each Square will now receive a <code>value</code> prop that will either be <code>'X'</code>, <code>'O'</code>, or <code>null</code> for empty squares.</p> <p>Next, you need to change what happens when a <code>Square</code> is clicked. The <code>Board</code> component now maintains which squares are filled. You'll need to create a way for the <code>Square</code> to update the <code>Board</code>'s state. Since state is private to a component that defines it, you cannot update the <code>Board</code>'s state directly from <code>Square</code>.</p> <p>Instead, you'll pass down a function from the <code>Board</code> component to the <code>Square</code> component, and you'll have <code>Square</code> call that function when a square is clicked. You'll start with the function that the <code>Square</code> component will call when it is clicked. You'll call that function <code>onSquareClick</code>:</p> <pre><code>function Square({ value }) {\nreturn (\n&lt;button className=\"square\" on_click={onSquareClick}&gt;\n{value}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Next, you'll add the <code>onSquareClick</code> function to the <code>Square</code> component's props:</p> <pre><code>function Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {\nreturn (\n&lt;button className=\"square\" on_click={onSquareClick}&gt;\n{value}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now you'll connect the <code>onSquareClick</code> prop to a function in the <code>Board</code> component that you'll name <code>handleClick</code>. To connect <code>onSquareClick</code> to <code>handleClick</code> you'll pass a function to the <code>onSquareClick</code> prop of the first <code>Square</code> component:</p> <pre><code>export default function Board() {\nconst [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={handleClick} /&gt;\n//...\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Lastly, you will define the <code>handleClick</code> function inside the Board component to update the <code>squares</code> array holding your board's state:</p> <pre><code>export default function Board() {\nconst [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\nfunction handleClick() {\nconst nextSquares = squares.slice();\nnextSquares[0] = \"X\";\nsetSquares(nextSquares);\n}\n\nreturn (\n// ...\n)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>handleClick</code> function creates a copy of the <code>squares</code> array (<code>nextSquares</code>) with the JavaScript <code>slice()</code> Array method. Then, <code>handleClick</code> updates the <code>nextSquares</code> array to add <code>X</code> to the first (<code>[0]</code> index) square.</p> <p>Calling the <code>setSquares</code> function lets React know the state of the component has changed. This will trigger a re-render of the components that use the <code>squares</code> state (<code>Board</code>) as well as its child components (the <code>Square</code> components that make up the board).</p> <p> <p>JavaScript supports closures which means an inner function (e.g. <code>handleClick</code>) has access to variables and functions defined in a outer function (e.g. <code>Board</code>). The <code>handleClick</code> function can read the <code>squares</code> state and call the <code>setSquares</code> method because they are both defined inside of the <code>Board</code> function.</p> <p></p> <p>Now you can add X's to the board... but only to the upper left square. Your <code>handleClick</code> function is hardcoded to update the index for the upper left square (<code>0</code>). Let's update <code>handleClick</code> to be able to update any square. Add an argument <code>i</code> to the <code>handleClick</code> function that takes the index of the square to update:</p> <pre><code>export default function Board() {\nconst [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\nfunction handleClick(i) {\nconst nextSquares = squares.slice();\nnextSquares[i] = \"X\";\nsetSquares(nextSquares);\n}\n\nreturn (\n// ...\n)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Next, you will need to pass that <code>i</code> to <code>handleClick</code>. You could try to set the <code>onSquareClick</code> prop of square to be <code>handleClick(0)</code> directly in the JSX like this, but it won't work:</p> <pre><code>&lt;Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={handleClick(0)} /&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Here is why this doesn't work. The <code>handleClick(0)</code> call will be a part of rendering the board component. Because <code>handleClick(0)</code> alters the state of the board component by calling <code>setSquares</code>, your entire board component will be re-rendered again. But this runs <code>handleClick(0)</code> again, leading to an infinite loop:</p> <p> <p>Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop.</p> <p></p> <p>Why didn't this problem happen earlier?</p> <p>When you were passing <code>onSquareClick={handleClick}</code>, you were passing the <code>handleClick</code> function down as a prop. You were not calling it! But now you are calling that function right away--notice the parentheses in <code>handleClick(0)</code>--and that's why it runs too early. You don't want to call <code>handleClick</code> until the user clicks!</p> <p>You could fix by creating a function like <code>handleFirstSquareClick</code> that calls <code>handleClick(0)</code>, a function like <code>handleSecondSquareClick</code> that calls <code>handleClick(1)</code>, and so on. You would pass (rather than call) these functions down as props like <code>onSquareClick={handleFirstSquareClick}</code>. This would solve the infinite loop.</p> <p>However, defining nine different functions and giving each of them a name is too verbose. Instead, let's do this:</p> <pre><code>export default function Board() {\n// ...\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(0)} /&gt;\n// ...\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Notice the new <code>() =&gt;</code> syntax. Here, <code>() =&gt; handleClick(0)</code> is an arrow function, which is a shorter way to define functions. When the square is clicked, the code after the <code>=&gt;</code> \"arrow\" will run, calling <code>handleClick(0)</code>.</p> <p>Now you need to update the other eight squares to call <code>handleClick</code> from the arrow functions you pass. Make sure that the argument for each call of the <code>handleClick</code> corresponds to the index of the correct square:</p> <pre><code>export default function Board() {\n// ...\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[0]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(0)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[1]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(1)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[2]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(2)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[3]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(3)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[4]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(4)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[5]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(5)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[6]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(6)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[7]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(7)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[8]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(8)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now you can again add X's to any square on the board by clicking on them:</p> <p></p> <p>But this time all the state management is handled by the <code>Board</code> component!</p> <p>This is what your code should look like:</p> <pre><code>import { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {\nreturn (\n&lt;button className=\"square\" on_click={onSquareClick}&gt;\n{value}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n);\n}\n\nexport default function Board() {\nconst [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\nfunction handleClick(i) {\nconst nextSquares = squares.slice();\nnextSquares[i] = \"X\";\nsetSquares(nextSquares);\n}\n\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[0]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(0)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[1]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(1)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[2]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(2)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[3]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(3)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[4]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(4)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[5]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(5)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[6]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(6)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[7]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(7)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[8]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(8)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>* {\nbox-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\nbody {\nfont-family: sans-serif;\nmargin: 20px;\npadding: 0;\n}\n\n.square {\nbackground: #fff;\nborder: 1px solid #999;\nfloat: left;\nfont-size: 24px;\nfont-weight: bold;\nline-height: 34px;\nheight: 34px;\nmargin-right: -1px;\nmargin-top: -1px;\npadding: 0;\ntext-align: center;\nwidth: 34px;\n}\n\n.board-row:after {\nclear: both;\ncontent: \"\";\ndisplay: table;\n}\n\n.status {\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n.game {\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: row;\n}\n\n.game-info {\nmargin-left: 20px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now that your state handling is in the <code>Board</code> component, the parent <code>Board</code> component passes props to the child <code>Square</code> components so that they can be displayed correctly. When clicking on a <code>Square</code>, the child <code>Square</code> component now asks the parent <code>Board</code> component to update the state of the board. When the <code>Board</code>'s state changes, both the <code>Board</code> component and every child <code>Square</code> re-renders automatically. Keeping the state of all squares in the <code>Board</code> component will allow it to determine the winner in the future.</p> <p>Let's recap what happens when a user clicks the top left square on your board to add an <code>X</code> to it:</p> <ol> <li>Clicking on the upper left square runs the function that the <code>button</code> received as its <code>on_click</code> prop from the <code>Square</code>. The <code>Square</code> component received that function as its <code>onSquareClick</code> prop from the <code>Board</code>. The <code>Board</code> component defined that function directly in the JSX. It calls <code>handleClick</code> with an argument of <code>0</code>.</li> <li><code>handleClick</code> uses the argument (<code>0</code>) to update the first element of the <code>squares</code> array from <code>null</code> to <code>X</code>.</li> <li>The <code>squares</code> state of the <code>Board</code> component was updated, so the <code>Board</code> and all of its children re-render. This causes the <code>value</code> prop of the <code>Square</code> component with index <code>0</code> to change from <code>null</code> to <code>X</code>.</li> </ol> <p>In the end the user sees that the upper left square has changed from empty to having a <code>X</code> after clicking it.</p> <p> <p>The DOM <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element's <code>on_click</code> attribute has a special meaning to React because it is a built-in component. For custom components like Square, the naming is up to you. You could give any name to the <code>Square</code>'s <code>onSquareClick</code> prop or <code>Board</code>'s <code>handleClick</code> function, and the code would work the same. In React, it's conventional to use <code>onSomething</code> names for props which represent events and <code>handleSomething</code> for the function definitions which handle those events.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe/#why-immutability-is-important","title":"Why immutability is important","text":"<p>Note how in <code>handleClick</code>, you call <code>.slice()</code> to create a copy of the <code>squares</code> array instead of modifying the existing array. To explain why, we need to discuss immutability and why immutability is important to learn.</p> <p>There are generally two approaches to changing data. The first approach is to mutate the data by directly changing the data's values. The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the desired changes. Here is what it would look like if you mutated the <code>squares</code> array:</p> <pre><code>const squares = [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];\nsquares[0] = \"X\";\n// Now `squares` is [\"X\", null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];\n</code></pre> <p>And here is what it would look like if you changed data without mutating the <code>squares</code> array:</p> <pre><code>const squares = [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];\nconst nextSquares = [\"X\", null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];\n// Now `squares` is unchanged, but `nextSquares` first element is 'X' rather than `null`\n</code></pre> <p>The result is the same but by not mutating (changing the underlying data) directly, you gain several benefits.</p> <p>Immutability makes complex features much easier to implement. Later in this tutorial, you will implement a \"time travel\" feature that lets you review the game's history and \"jump back\" to past moves. This functionality isn't specific to games--an ability to undo and redo certain actions is a common requirement for apps. Avoiding direct data mutation lets you keep previous versions of the data intact, and reuse them later.</p> <p>There is also another benefit of immutability. By default, all child components re-render automatically when the state of a parent component changes. This includes even the child components that weren't affected by the change. Although re-rendering is not by itself noticeable to the user (you shouldn't actively try to avoid it!), you might want to skip re-rendering a part of the tree that clearly wasn't affected by it for performance reasons. Immutability makes it very cheap for components to compare whether their data has changed or not. You can learn more about how React chooses when to re-render a component in the <code>memo</code> API reference.</p>"},{"location":"learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe/#taking-turns","title":"Taking turns","text":"<p>It's now time to fix a major defect in this tic-tac-toe game: the \"O\"s cannot be marked on the board.</p> <p>You'll set the first move to be \"X\" by default.

This gives the <code>Game</code> component full control over the <code>Board</code>'s data and lets it instruct the <code>Board</code> to render previous turns from the <code>history</code>.</p> <p>First, add a <code>Game</code> component with <code>export default</code>.

The additional <code>div</code>s returned by the <code>Game</code> component are making room for the game information you'll add to the board later.</p> <p>Add some state to the <code>Game</code> component to track which player is next and the history of moves:</p> <pre><code>export default function Game() {\nconst [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\nconst [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);\n// ...\n</code></pre> <p>Notice how <code>[Array(9).fill(null)]</code> is an array with a single item, which itself is an array of 9 <code>null</code>s.</p> <p>To render the squares for the current move, you'll want to read the last squares array from the <code>history</code>.

Pass <code>xIsNext</code>, <code>currentSquares</code> and <code>handlePlay</code> as props to the <code>Board</code> component:</p> <pre><code>export default function Game() {\nconst [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\nconst [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);\nconst currentSquares = history[history.length - 1];\n\nfunction handlePlay(nextSquares) {\n// TODO\n}\n\nreturn (\n&lt;div className=\"game\"&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"game-board\"&gt;\n&lt;Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} /&gt;\n//...\n)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Let's make the <code>Board</code> component fully controlled by the props it receives. Change the <code>Board</code> component to take three props: <code>xIsNext</code>, <code>squares</code>, and a new <code>onPlay</code> function that <code>Board</code> can call with the updated squares array when a player makes a move. Next, remove the first two lines of the <code>Board</code> function that call <code>useState</code>:</p> <pre><code>function Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {\nfunction handleClick(i) {\n//...\n}\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now replace the <code>setSquares</code> and <code>setXIsNext</code> calls in <code>handleClick</code> in the <code>Board</code> component with a single call to your new <code>onPlay</code> function so the <code>Game</code> component can update the <code>Board</code> when the user clicks a square:</p> <pre><code>function Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {\nfunction handleClick(i) {\nif (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {\nreturn;\n}\nconst nextSquares = squares.slice();\nif (xIsNext) {\nnextSquares[i] = \"X\";\n} else {\nnextSquares[i] = \"O\";\n}\nonPlay(nextSquares);\n}\n//...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>Board</code> component is fully controlled by the props passed to it by the <code>Game</code> component. You need to implement the <code>handlePlay</code> function in the <code>Game</code> component to get the game working again.</p> <p>What should <code>handlePlay</code> do when called? Remember that Board used to call <code>setSquares</code> with an updated array; now it passes the updated <code>squares</code> array to <code>onPlay</code>.</p> <p>The <code>handlePlay</code> function needs to update <code>Game</code>'s state to trigger a re-render, but you don't have a <code>setSquares</code> function that you can call any more--you're now using the <code>history</code> state variable to store this information. You'll want to update <code>history</code> by appending the updated <code>squares</code> array as a new history entry. You also want to toggle <code>xIsNext</code>, just as Board used to do:</p> <pre><code>export default function Game() {\n//...\nfunction handlePlay(nextSquares) {\nsetHistory([...history, nextSquares]);\nsetXIsNext(!xIsNext);\n}\n//...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here, <code>[...history, nextSquares]</code> creates a new array that contains all the items in <code>history</code>, followed by <code>nextSquares</code>. (You can read the <code>...history</code> spread syntax as \"enumerate all the items in <code>history</code>\".)</p> <p>For example, if <code>history</code> is <code>[[null,null,null], [\"X\",null,null]]</code> and <code>nextSquares</code> is <code>[\"X\",null,\"O\"]</code>, then the new <code>[...history, nextSquares]</code> array will be <code>[[null,null,null], [\"X\",null,null], [\"X\",null,\"O\"]]</code>.</p> <p>At this point, you've moved the state to live in the <code>Game</code> component, and the UI should be fully working, just as it was before the refactor. Here is what the code should look like at this point:</p> <pre><code>import { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {\nreturn (\n&lt;button className=\"square\" on_click={onSquareClick}&gt;\n{value}\n&lt;/button&gt;\n);\n}\n\nfunction Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {\nfunction handleClick(i) {\nif (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {\nreturn;\n}\nconst nextSquares = squares.slice();\nif (xIsNext) {\nnextSquares[i] = \"X\";\n} else {\nnextSquares[i] = \"O\";\n}\nonPlay(nextSquares);\n}\n\nconst winner = calculateWinner(squares);\nlet status;\nif (winner) {\nstatus = \"Winner: \" + winner;\n} else {\nstatus = \"Next player: \" + (xIsNext ? \"X\" : \"O\");\n}\n\nreturn (\n&lt;&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"status\"&gt;{status}&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[0]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(0)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[1]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(1)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[2]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(2)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[3]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(3)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[4]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(4)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[5]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(5)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"board-row\"&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[6]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(6)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[7]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(7)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;Square\nvalue={squares[8]}\nonSquareClick={() =&gt; handleClick(8)}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n);\n}\n\nexport default function Game() {\nconst [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\nconst [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);\nconst currentSquares = history[history.length - 1];\n\nfunction handlePlay(nextSquares) {\nsetHistory([...history, nextSquares]);\nsetXIsNext(!xIsNext);\n}\n\nreturn (\n&lt;div className=\"game\"&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"game-board\"&gt;\n&lt;Board\nxIsNext={xIsNext}\nsquares={currentSquares}\nonPlay={handlePlay}\n/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div className=\"game-info\"&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;{/*TODO*/}&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n);\n}\n\nfunction calculateWinner(squares) {\nconst lines = [\n[0, 1, 2],\n[3, 4, 5],\n[6, 7, 8],\n[0, 3, 6],\n[1, 4, 7],\n[2, 5, 8],\n[0, 4, 8],\n[2, 4, 6],\n];\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; lines.length; i++) {\nconst [a, b, c] = lines[i];\nif (\nsquares[a] &amp;&amp;\nsquares[a] === squares[b] &amp;&amp;\nsquares[a] === squares[c]\n) {\nreturn squares[a];\n}\n}\nreturn null;\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>* {\nbox-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\nbody {\nfont-family: sans-serif;\nmargin: 20px;\npadding: 0;\n}\n\n.square {\nbackground: #fff;\nborder: 1px solid #999;\nfloat: left;\nfont-size: 24px;\nfont-weight: bold;\nline-height: 34px;\nheight: 34px;\nmargin-right: -1px;\nmargin-top: -1px;\npadding: 0;\ntext-align: center;\nwidth: 34px;\n}\n\n.board-row:after {\nclear: both;\ncontent: \"\";\ndisplay: table;\n}\n\n.status {\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n.game {\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: row;\n}\n\n.game-info {\nmargin-left: 20px;\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe/#showing-the-past-moves","title":"Showing the past moves","text":"<p>Since you are recording the tic-tac-toe game's history, you can now display a list of past moves to the player.</p> <p>React elements like <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> are regular JavaScript objects; you can pass them around in your application.

When you update a list, React needs to determine what has changed. You could have added, removed, re-arranged, or updated the list's items.</p> <p>Imagine transitioning from</p> <pre><code>&lt;li&gt;Alexa: 7 tasks left&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ben: 5 tasks left&lt;/li&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>to</p> <pre><code>&lt;li&gt;Ben: 9 tasks left&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Claudia: 8 tasks left&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Alexa: 5 tasks left&lt;/li&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>In addition to the updated counts, a human reading this would probably say that you swapped Alexa and Ben's ordering and inserted Claudia between Alexa and Ben. However, React is a computer program and can't know what you intended, so you need to specify a key property for each list item to differentiate each list item from its siblings. If your data was from a database, Alexa, Ben, and Claudia's database IDs could be used as keys.</p> <pre><code>&lt;li key={user.id}&gt;\n{user.name}: {user.taskCount} tasks left\n&lt;/li&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>When a list is re-rendered, React takes each list item's key and searches the previous list's items for a matching key. If the current list has a key that didn't exist before, React creates a component. If the current list is missing a key that existed in the previous list, React destroys the previous component. If two keys match, the corresponding component is moved.</p> <p>Keys tell React about the identity of each component, which allows React to maintain state between re-renders. If a component's key changes, the component will be destroyed and re-created with a new state.</p> <p><code>key</code> is a special and reserved property in React. When an element is created, React extracts the <code>key</code> property and stores the key directly on the returned element. Even though <code>key</code> may look like it is passed as props, React automatically uses <code>key</code> to decide which components to update. There's no way for a component to ask what <code>key</code> its parent specified.</p> <p>It's strongly recommended that you assign proper keys whenever you build dynamic lists. If you don't have an appropriate key, you may want to consider restructuring your data so that you do.</p> <p>If no key is specified, React will report an error and use the array index as a key by default. Using the array index as a key is problematic when trying to re-order a list's items or inserting/removing list items. Explicitly passing <code>key={i}</code> silences the error but has the same problems as array indices and is not recommended in most cases.</p> <p>Keys do not need to be globally unique; they only need to be unique between components and their siblings.</p>"},{"location":"learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe/#implementing-time-travel","title":"Implementing time travel","text":"<p>In the tic-tac-toe game's history, each past move has a unique ID associated with it: it's the sequential number of the move.

So you can clearly see how state has changed between renders.</li> <li>Optimizations: Common React optimization strategies rely on skipping work if previous props or state are the same as the next ones. If you never mutate state, it is very fast to check whether there were any changes. If <code>prevObj === obj</code>, you can be sure that nothing could have changed inside of it.</li> <li>New Features: The new React features we're building rely on state being treated like a snapshot. If you're mutating past versions of state, that may prevent you from using the new features.</li> <li>Requirement Changes: Some application features, like implementing Undo/Redo, showing a history of changes, or letting the user reset a form to earlier values, are easier to do when nothing is mutated. This is because you can keep past copies of state in memory, and reuse them when appropriate. If you start with a mutative approach, features like this can be difficult to add later on.</li> <li>Simpler Implementation: Because React does not rely on mutation, it does not need to do anything special with your objects. It does not need to hijack their properties, always wrap them into Proxies, or do other work at initialization as many \"reactive\" solutions do. This is also why React lets you put any object into state--no matter how large--without additional performance or correctness pitfalls.</li> </ul> <p>In practice, you can often \"get away\" with mutating state in React, but we strongly advise you not to do that so that you can use new React features developed with this approach in mind.

When you update the state, React will first call your component functions to calculate what should be on the screen. Then React will \"commit\" these changes to the DOM, updating the screen. Then React will run your Effects. If your Effect also immediately updates the state, this restarts the whole process from scratch! To avoid the unnecessary render passes, transform all the data at the top level of your components. That code will automatically re-run whenever your props or state change.</li> <li>You don't need Effects to handle user events. For example, let's say you want to send an <code>/api/buy</code> POST request and show a notification when the user buys a product.

This is why you'll usually handle user events in the corresponding event handlers.</li> </ul> <p>You do need Effects to synchronize with external systems. For example, you can write an Effect that keeps a jQuery widget synchronized with the React state.

One day, you notice a problem: when you navigate from one profile to another, the <code>comment</code> state does not get reset. As a result, it's easy to accidentally post a comment on a wrong user's profile. To fix the issue, you want to clear out the <code>comment</code> state variable whenever the <code>userId</code> changes:</p> <pre><code>export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) {\nconst [comment, setComment] = useState(\"\");\n\n// \ud83d\udd34 Avoid: Resetting state on prop change in an Effect\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nsetComment(\"\");\n}, [userId]);\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This is inefficient because <code>ProfilePage</code> and its children will first render with the stale value, and then render again. It is also complicated because you'd need to do this in every component that has some state inside <code>ProfilePage</code>. For example, if the comment UI is nested, you'd want to clear out nested comment state too.</p> <p>Instead, you can tell React that each user's profile is conceptually a different profile by giving it an explicit key.

By passing <code>userId</code> as a <code>key</code> to the <code>Profile</code> component, you're asking React to treat two <code>Profile</code> components with different <code>userId</code> as two different components that should not share any state. Whenever the key (which you've set to <code>userId</code>) changes, React will recreate the DOM and reset the state of the <code>Profile</code> component and all of its children. Now the <code>comment</code> field will clear out automatically when navigating between profiles.</p> <p>Note that in this example, only the outer <code>ProfilePage</code> component is exported and visible to other files in the project. Components rendering <code>ProfilePage</code> don't need to pass the key to it: they pass <code>userId</code> as a regular prop. The fact <code>ProfilePage</code> passes it as a <code>key</code> to the inner <code>Profile</code> component is an implementation detail.</p>"},{"location":"learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect/#adjusting-some-state-when-a-prop-changes","title":"Adjusting some state when a prop changes","text":"<p>Sometimes, you might want to reset or adjust a part of the state on a prop change, but not all of it.</p> <p>This <code>List</code> component receives a list of <code>items</code> as a prop, and maintains the selected item in the <code>selection</code> state variable.

Every time the <code>items</code> change, the <code>List</code> and its child components will render with a stale <code>selection</code> value at first. Then React will update the DOM and run the Effects. Finally, the <code>setSelection(null)</code> call will cause another re-render of the <code>List</code> and its child components, restarting this whole process again.</p> <p>Start by deleting the Effect. Instead, adjust the state directly during rendering:</p> <pre><code>function List({ items }) {\nconst [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);\nconst [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);\n\n// Better: Adjust the state while rendering\nconst [prevItems, setPrevItems] = useState(items);\nif (items !== prevItems) {\nsetPrevItems(items);\nsetSelection(null);\n}\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Storing information from previous renders like this can be hard to understand, but it\u2019s better than updating the same state in an Effect. In the above example, <code>setSelection</code> is called directly during a render. React will re-render the <code>List</code> immediately after it exits with a <code>return</code> statement. React has not rendered the <code>List</code> children or updated the DOM yet, so this lets the <code>List</code> children skip rendering the stale <code>selection</code> value.</p> <p>When you update a component during rendering, React throws away the returned JSX and immediately retries rendering. To avoid very slow cascading retries, React only lets you update the same component's state during a render. If you update another component's state during a render, you'll see an error. A condition like <code>items !== prevItems</code> is necessary to avoid loops. You may adjust state like this, but any other side effects (like changing the DOM or setting timeouts) should stay in event handlers or Effects to keep components pure.</p> <p>Although this pattern is more efficient than an Effect, most components shouldn't need it either. No matter how you do it, adjusting state based on props or other state makes your data flow more difficult to understand and debug. Always check whether you can reset all state with a key or calculate everything during rendering instead. For example, instead of storing (and resetting) the selected item, you can store the selected item ID:</p> <pre><code>function List({ items }) {\nconst [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);\nconst [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null);\n// \u2705 Best: Calculate everything during rendering\nconst selection = items.find((item) =&gt; item.id === selectedId) ?? null;\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now there is no need to \"adjust\" the state at all. If the item with the selected ID is in the list, it remains selected. If it's not, the <code>selection</code> calculated during rendering will be <code>null</code> because no matching item was found.

Imagine you are adding a way to step through the history of the game moves. You'd do it by updating each state variable to a value from the past. However, setting the <code>card</code> state to a value from the past would trigger the Effect chain again and change the data you're showing.

You want to notify the parent component whenever the <code>Toggle</code> internal state changes, so you expose an <code>onChange</code> event and call it from an Effect:</p> <pre><code>function Toggle({ onChange }) {\nconst [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);\n\n// \ud83d\udd34 Avoid: The onChange handler runs too late\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nonChange(isOn);\n}, [isOn, onChange]);\n\nfunction handleClick() {\nsetIsOn(!isOn);\n}\n\nfunction handleDragEnd(e) {\nif (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {\nsetIsOn(true);\n} else {\nsetIsOn(false);\n}\n}\n\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Like earlier, this is not ideal. The <code>Toggle</code> updates its state first, and React updates the screen. Then React runs the Effect, which calls the <code>onChange</code> function passed from a parent component. Now the parent component will update its own state, starting another render pass. It would be better to do everything in a single pass.</p> <p>Delete the Effect and instead update the state of both components within the same event handler:</p> <pre><code>function Toggle({ onChange }) {\nconst [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);\n\nfunction updateToggle(nextIsOn) {\n// \u2705 Good: Perform all updates during the event that caused them\nsetIsOn(nextIsOn);\nonChange(nextIsOn);\n}\n\nfunction handleClick() {\nupdateToggle(!isOn);\n}\n\nfunction handleDragEnd(e) {\nif (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {\nupdateToggle(true);\n} else {\nupdateToggle(false);\n}\n}\n\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>With this approach, both the <code>Toggle</code> component and its parent component update their state during the event. React batches updates from different components together, so there will only be one render pass.</p> <p>You might also be able to remove the state altogether, and instead receive <code>isOn</code> from the parent component:</p> <pre><code>// \u2705 Also good: the component is fully controlled by its parent\nfunction Toggle({ isOn, onChange }) {\nfunction handleClick() {\nonChange(!isOn);\n}\n\nfunction handleDragEnd(e) {\nif (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {\nonChange(true);\n} else {\nonChange(false);\n}\n}\n\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>\"Lifting state up\" lets the parent component fully control the <code>Toggle</code> by toggling the parent's own state. This means the parent component will have to contain more logic, but there will be less state overall to worry about. Whenever you try to keep two different state variables synchronized, try lifting state up instead!</p>"},{"location":"learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect/#passing-data-to-the-parent","title":"Passing data to the parent","text":"<p>This <code>Child</code> component fetches some data and then passes it to the <code>Parent</code> component in an Effect:</p> <pre><code>function Parent() {\nconst [data, setData] = useState(null);\n// ...\nreturn &lt;Child onFetched={setData} /&gt;;\n}\n\nfunction Child({ onFetched }) {\nconst data = useSomeAPI();\n// \ud83d\udd34 Avoid: Passing data to the parent in an Effect\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nif (data) {\nonFetched(data);\n}\n}, [onFetched, data]);\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In React, data flows from the parent components to their children. When you see something wrong on the screen, you can trace where the information comes from by going up the component chain until you find which component passes the wrong prop or has the wrong state. When child components update the state of their parent components in Effects, the data flow becomes very difficult to trace. Since both the child and the parent need the same data, let the parent component fetch that data, and pass it down to the child instead:</p> <pre><code>function Parent() {\nconst data = useSomeAPI();\n// ...\n// \u2705 Good: Passing data down to the child\nreturn &lt;Child data={data} /&gt;;\n}\n\nfunction Child({ data }) {\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This is simpler and keeps the data flow predictable: the data flows down from the parent to the child.</p>"},{"location":"learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect/#subscribing-to-an-external-store","title":"Subscribing to an external store","text":"<p>Sometimes, your components may need to subscribe to some data outside of the React state. This data could be from a third-party library or a built-in browser API. Since this data can change without React's knowledge, you need to manually subscribe your components to it. This is often done with an Effect, for example:</p> <pre><code>function useOnlineStatus() {\n// Not ideal: Manual store subscription in an Effect\nconst [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nfunction updateState() {\nsetIsOnline(navigator.onLine);\n}\n\nupdateState();\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"online\", updateState);\nwindow.addEventListener(\"offline\", updateState);\nreturn () =&gt; {\nwindow.removeEventListener(\"online\", updateState);\nwindow.removeEventListener(\"offline\", updateState);\n};\n}, []);\nreturn isOnline;\n}\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\nconst isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here, the component subscribes to an external data store (in this case, the browser <code>navigator.onLine</code> API). Since this API does not exist on the server (so it can't be used for the initial HTML), initially the state is set to <code>true</code>. Whenever the value of that data store changes in the browser, the component updates its state.</p> <p>Although it's common to use Effects for this, React has a purpose-built Hook for subscribing to an external store that is preferred instead. Delete the Effect and replace it with a call to <code>useSyncExternalStore</code>:</p> <pre><code>function subscribe(callback) {\nwindow.addEventListener(\"online\", callback);\nwindow.addEventListener(\"offline\", callback);\nreturn () =&gt; {\nwindow.removeEventListener(\"online\", callback);\nwindow.removeEventListener(\"offline\", callback);\n};\n}\n\nfunction useOnlineStatus() {\n// \u2705 Good: Subscribing to an external store with a built-in Hook\nreturn useSyncExternalStore(\nsubscribe, // React won't resubscribe for as long as you pass the same function\n() =&gt; navigator.onLine, // How to get the value on the client\n() =&gt; true // How to get the value on the server\n);\n}\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\nconst isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This approach is less error-prone than manually syncing mutable data to React state with an Effect. Typically, you'll write a custom Hook like <code>useOnlineStatus()</code> above so that you don't need to repeat this code in the individual components. Read more about subscribing to external stores from React components.</p>"},{"location":"learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect/#fetching-data","title":"Fetching data","text":"<p>Many apps use Effects to kick off data fetching. It is quite common to write a data fetching Effect like this:</p> <pre><code>function SearchResults({ query }) {\nconst [results, setResults] = useState([]);\nconst [page, setPage] = useState(1);\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\n// \ud83d\udd34 Avoid: Fetching without cleanup logic\nfetchResults(query, page).then((json) =&gt; {\nsetResults(json);\n});\n}, [query, page]);\n\nfunction handleNextPageClick() {\nsetPage(page + 1);\n}\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You don't need to move this fetch to an event handler.</p> <p>This might seem like a contradiction with the earlier examples where you needed to put the logic into the event handlers! However, consider that it's not the typing event that's the main reason to fetch. Search inputs are often prepopulated from the URL, and the user might navigate Back and Forward without touching the input.</p> <p>It doesn't matter where <code>page</code> and <code>query</code> come from. While this component is visible, you want to keep <code>results</code> synchronized with data from the network for the current <code>page</code> and <code>query</code>. This is why it's an Effect.</p> <p>However, the code above has a bug. Imagine you type <code>\"hello\"</code> fast. Then the <code>query</code> will change from <code>\"h\"</code>, to <code>\"he\"</code>, <code>\"hel\"</code>, <code>\"hell\"</code>, and <code>\"hello\"</code>. This will kick off separate fetches, but there is no guarantee about which order the responses will arrive in. For example, the <code>\"hell\"</code> response may arrive after the <code>\"hello\"</code> response. Since it will call <code>setResults()</code> last, you will be displaying the wrong search results. This is called a \"race condition\": two different requests \"raced\" against each other and came in a different order than you expected.</p> <p>To fix the race condition, you need to add a cleanup function to ignore stale responses:</p> <pre><code>function SearchResults({ query }) {\nconst [results, setResults] = useState([]);\nconst [page, setPage] = useState(1);\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nlet ignore = false;\nfetchResults(query, page).then((json) =&gt; {\nif (!ignore) {\nsetResults(json);\n}\n});\nreturn () =&gt; {\nignore = true;\n};\n}, [query, page]);\n\nfunction handleNextPageClick() {\nsetPage(page + 1);\n}\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This ensures that when your Effect fetches data, all responses except the last requested one will be ignored.</p> <p>Handling race conditions is not the only difficulty with implementing data fetching. You might also want to think about caching responses (so that the user can click Back and see the previous screen instantly), how to fetch data on the server (so that the initial server-rendered HTML contains the fetched content instead of a spinner), and how to avoid network waterfalls (so that a child can fetch data without waiting for every parent).</p> <p>These issues apply to any UI library, not just React. Solving them is not trivial, which is why modern frameworks provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than fetching data in Effects.</p> <p>If you don't use a framework (and don't want to build your own) but would like to make data fetching from Effects more ergonomic, consider extracting your fetching logic into a custom Hook like in this example:</p> <pre><code>function SearchResults({ query }) {\nconst [page, setPage] = useState(1);\nconst params = new URLSearchParams({ query, page });\nconst results = useData(`/api/search?${params}`);\n\nfunction handleNextPageClick() {\nsetPage(page + 1);\n}\n// ...\n}\n\nfunction useData(url) {\nconst [data, setData] = useState(null);\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\nlet ignore = false;\nfetch(url)\n.then((response) =&gt; response.json())\n.then((json) =&gt; {\nif (!ignore) {\nsetData(json);\n}\n});\nreturn () =&gt; {\nignore = true;\n};\n}, [url]);\nreturn data;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You'll likely also want to add some logic for error handling and to track whether the content is loading. You can build a Hook like this yourself or use one of the many solutions already available in the React ecosystem. Although this alone won't be as efficient as using a framework's built-in data fetching mechanism, moving the data fetching logic into a custom Hook will make it easier to adopt an efficient data fetching strategy later.</p> <p>In general, whenever you have to resort to writing Effects, keep an eye out for when you can extract a piece of functionality into a custom Hook with a more declarative and purpose-built API like <code>useData</code> above. The fewer raw <code>useEffect</code> calls you have in your components, the easier you will find to maintain your application.</p> <p> <ul> <li>If you can calculate something during render, you don't need an Effect.</li> <li>To cache expensive calculations, add <code>useMemo</code> instead of <code>useEffect</code>.</li> <li>To reset the state of an entire component tree, pass a different <code>key</code> to it.</li> <li>To reset a particular bit of state in response to a prop change, set it during rendering.</li> <li>Code that runs because a component was displayed should be in Effects, the rest should be in events.</li> <li>If you need to update the state of several components, it's better to do it during a single event.</li> <li>Whenever you try to synchronize state variables in different components, consider lifting state up.</li> <li>You can fetch data with Effects, but you need to implement cleanup to avoid race conditions.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>"},{"location":"learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect/#transform-data-without-effects","title":"Transform data without Effects","text":"<p>The <code>TodoList</code> below displays a list of todos.
