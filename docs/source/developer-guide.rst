Developer Guide
===============

.. note::

    If you have any questions during set up or development post on our
    `discussion board <https://github.com/idom-team/idom/discussions>`__ and we'll
    answer them.

This project uses the `GitHub Flow`_ (more detail :ref:`below <Making a Pull Request>`)
for collaboration and consists primarilly of Python code and Javascript code. A variety
of tools are used to aid in its development. Below is a short list of the tools which
will be most commonly referenced in the sections to follow:

Making a Pull Request
---------------------

To make your first code contribution to IDOM, you'll need to install Git_ (or
`Git Bash`_ on Windows). Thankfully there are many helpful
`tutorials <https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md>`__
about how to get started. To make a change to IDOM you'll do the following:

`Fork IDOM <https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo>`__:
    Go to `this URL <https://github.com/idom-team/idom>`__ and click the "Fork" button.

`Clone your fork <https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository>`__:
    You use a ``git clone`` command to copy the code from GitHub to your computer.

`Create a new branch <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging>`__:
    You'll ``git checkout -b your-first-branch`` to create a new space to start your work

:ref:`Prepare your Development Environment <Development Environment>`:
    We explain in more detail below how to install all IDOM's dependencies

`Push your changes <https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository>`__:
    Once you've made changes to IDOM, you'll ``git push`` them to your fork.

`Create a Pull Request <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`__:
    We'll review your changes, run some :ref:`tests <Running The Tests>` and
    :ref:`qaulity checks <Code Quality Checks>` and, with any luck, accept your request.
    At that point your contribution will be merged into the main codebase!


Development Environment
-----------------------

If you've already :ref:
In order to work with IDOM's source code you'll need to install Git_ (or `Git Bash`_ on
Windows). Once done you can clone a local copy of this repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/idom-team/idom.git
    cd idom

At this point you should be able to run the command below to:

- Install an editable version of the Python code

- Download, build, and install Javascript dependencies

- Install some pre-commit_ hooks for Git

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e . -r requirements.txt && pre-commit install

If you modify any Javascript, you'll need to re-install IDOM:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .

However you may also ``cd`` to the ``idom/client/app`` directory which contains a
``package.json`` that you can use to run standard ``npm`` commands from.


Running The Tests
-----------------

The test suite for IDOM is executed using Nox_ and covers:

1. Server-side Python code with PyTest_

2. The end-to-end application using Selenium_

To run the full suite of tests you'll need to install:

- `Google Chrome`_

- ChromeDriver_.

.. warning::

    Be sure the version of `Google Chrome`_ and ChromeDriver_ you install are compatible.

Once you've installed the aforementined browser and web driver you should be able to
run:

.. code-block:: bash

    nox -s test

If you prefer to run the tests using a headless browser:

.. code-block:: bash

    nox -s test -- pytest[--headless]

You can pass other options to pytest in a similar manner:

.. code-block:: bash

    nox -s test -- pytest[arg,--flag,--key=value]


Code Quality Checks
-------------------

Several tools are run on the Python codebase to help validate its quality. For the most
part, if you set up your :ref:`Development Environment` with ``pre-commit`` to check
your work before you commit it, then you'll be notified when changes need to be made or,
in the best case, changes will be made automatically for you.

The following are currently being used:

- MyPy_ - a static type checker
- Black_ - an opinionated code formatter
- Flake8_ - a style guide enforcement tool
- ISort_ - a utility for alphabetically sorting imports

The most strict measure of quality enforced on the codebase is 100% coverage. This means
that every line of coded added to IDOM requires a test case that excersizes it. This
doesn't prevent all bugs, but it should ensure that we catch the most common ones.

If you need help understanding why code you've submitted does not pass these checks,
then be sure to ask, either in the
`Community Forum <https://github.com/idom-team/idom/discussions>`__ or in your
:ref:`Pull Request <Making a Pull Request>`.

.. note::

    You can manually run ``nox -s format`` to auto format your code without having to
    do so via ``pre-commit``. However, many IDEs have integrations for automatically
    formatting upon saving a file
    (e.g.`VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_formatting>`__)


Building The Documentation
--------------------------

To build and display the documentation simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    nox -s docs

This will compile the documentation from its source files into HTML, start a web server,
and open a browser to display the now generated documentation. Whenever you change any
source files the web server will automatically rebuild the documentation and refresh the
page. Under the hood this is using
`sphinx-autobuild <https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-autobuild>`__.

To run some of the examples in the documentation as if they were tests run:

.. code-block::

    nox -s test_docs

Building the documentation as it's deployed in production requires Docker_. Once you've
installed, you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

    nox -s docs_in_docker

You should then navigate to  to see the documentation.


Release Process

Under construction...
