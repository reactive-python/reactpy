            Learn the basics of HTML and how to create it in IDOM

            :link: your-first-component

            Discover what components are and why their one of IDOM's foundational
            concepts.

            Leverage the reusability of components by passing them arguments

        .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`code-square` Conditional Rendering
            :link: conditional-rendering
            :link-type: doc

            Use what you've learned so far to add conditional logic to your components.

            Understand how IDOM keeps track of changing layout structures.

IDOM is a Python package for making user interfaces (UI). These interfaces are built
from small units of functionality like buttons text and images. IDOM allows you to
combine these units into reusable, nestable :ref:`"components" <your first component>`.
In the sections that follow you'll learn how these UI units are created and organized
into components. Then, you'll use components to customize and conditionally display more
complex UIs.
