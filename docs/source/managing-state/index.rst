            state.

            Allow components to vary vary together, by lifting state into common
            parents.

            Control if and how state is preserved by understanding it's relationship to
            the "UI tree".

            Consolidate state update logic outside your component in a single function,
            called a ‚Äúreducer".

            :link-type: doc

            Instead of passing shared state down deep component trees, bring state into
            "contexts" instead.

            You can combine reducers and context together to manage state of a complex
            screen.

Section 2: Shared Component State
---------------------------------

Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it,
remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it
down to them via props. This is known as ‚Äúlifting state up‚Äù, and it‚Äôs one of the most
common things you will do writing code with IDOM.

In the example below the search input and the list of elements below share the same
state, the state represents the food name. Note how the component ``Table`` gets called
at each change of state. The component is observing the state and reacting to state
changes automatically, just like it would do in React.
