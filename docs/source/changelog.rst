0.32.0
------

In addition to a variety of bug fixes and other minor improvements, there's a breaking
change to the custom component interface - instead of exporting multiple functions that
render custom components, we simply expect a single ``bind()`` function.
binding function then must return an object with a ``render()`` and ``unmount()``
function. This change was made in order to better support the rendering of child models.
See :ref:`Custom JavaScript Components` for details on the new interface.

0.31.0
------

The :class:`~idom.core.layout.Layout` is now a prototype, and ``Layout.update`` is no
longer a public API. This is combined with a much more significant refactor of the
underlying rendering logic.

The biggest issue that has been resolved relates to the relationship between
:class:`~idom.core.hooks.LifeCycleHook` and ``Layout``. Previously, the
``LifeCycleHook`` accepted a layout instance in its constructor and called
``Layout.update``. Additionally, the ``Layout`` would manipulate the
``LifeCycleHook.component`` attribute whenever the component instance changed after a
render. The former behavior leads to a non-linear code path that's a touch to follow.
The latter behavior is the most egregious design issue since there's absolutely no local
indication that the component instance can be swapped out (not even a comment).

The new refactor no longer binds component or layout instances to a ``LifeCycleHook``.
Instead, the hook simply receives an unparametrized callback that can be triggered to
schedule a render. While some error logs lose clarity (since we can't say what component
caused them). This change precludes a need for the layout to ever mutate the hook.

To accomodate this change, the internal representation of the layout's state had to
change. Previsouly, a class-based approach was take, where methods of the state-holding
classes were meant to handle all use cases. Now we rely much more heavily on very simple
(and mostly static) data structures that have purpose built constructor functions that
much more narrowly address each use case.

After these refactors, ``ComponentTypes`` no longer needs a unique ``id`` attribute.
Instead, a unique ID is generated internally which is associated with the
``LifeCycleState``, not component instances since they are inherently transient.

**Pull Requests**

- fix #419 and #412 - :pull:`422`


0.30.1
------

Removes the usage of the :func:`id` function for generating unique ideas because there
were situations where the IDs bound to the lifetime of an object are problematic. Also
adds a warning :class:`Deprecation` warning to render functions that include the
parameter ``key``. It's been decided that allowing ``key`` to be used in this way can
lead to confusing bugs.

**Pull Requests**

- warn if key is param of component render function - :pull:`421`
- fix :issue:`417` and :issue:`413` - :pull:`418`
- add changelog entry for :ref:`0.30.0` - :pull:`415`


0.30.0
------

With recent changes to the custom component interface, it's now possible to remove all
runtime reliance on NPM. Doing so has many virtuous knock-on effects:

1. Removal of large chunks of code
2. Greatly simplifies how users dynamically experiment with React component libraries,
   because their usage no longer requires a build step. Instead they can be loaded in
   the browser from a CDN that distributes ESM modules.
3. The built-in client code needs to make fewer assumption about where static resources
   are located, and as a result, it's also easier to coordinate the server and client
   code.
4. Alternate client implementations benefit from this simplicity. Now, it's possible to
   install idom-client-react normally and write a ``loadImportSource()`` function that
   looks for route serving the contents of `IDOM_WEB_MODULES_DIR.`

This change includes large breaking changes:

- The CLI is being removed as it won't be needed any longer
- The `idom.client` is being removed in favor of a stripped down ``idom.web`` module
- The `IDOM_CLIENT_BUILD_DIR` config option will no longer exist and a new
  ``IDOM_WEB_MODULES_DIR`` which only contains dynamically linked web modules. While
  this new directory's location is configurable, it is meant to be transient and should
  not be re-used across sessions.

The new ``idom.web`` module takes a simpler approach to constructing import sources and
expands upon the logic for resolving imports by allowing exports from URLs to be
discovered too. Now, that IDOM isn't using NPM to dynamically install component
libraries ``idom.web`` instead creates JS modules from template files and links them
into ``IDOM_WEB_MODULES_DIR``. These templates ultimately direct the browser to load the
desired library from a CDN.

0.29.0
------

Contains breaking changes, the most significant of which are:

- Moves the runtime client build directory to a "user data" directory rather a directory
  where IDOM's code was installed. This has the advantage of not requiring write
  permissions to rebuild the client if IDOM was installed globally rather than in a
  virtual environment.
- The custom JS component interface has been reworked to expose an API similar to
  the ``createElement``, ``render``, ``unmountComponentAtNode`` functions from React.

**Issues Fixed:**

- :issue:`375`
- :issue:`394`
- :issue:`401`

**Highlighted Commits:**

- add try/except around event handling - :commit:`f2bf589`
- do not call find_builtin_server_type at import time - :commit:`e29745e`
- import default from react/reactDOM/fast-json-patch - :commit:`74c8a34`
- no named exports for react/reactDOM - :commit:`f13bf35`
- debug logs for runtime build dir create/update - :commit:`af94f4e`
- put runtime build in user data dir - :commit:`0af69d2`
- change shared to update_on_change - :commit:`6c09a86`
- rework js module interface + fix docs - :commit:`699cc66`
- correctly serialize File object - :commit:`a2398dc`


0.28.0
------

Includes a wide variety of improvements:

- support ``currentTime`` attr of audio/video elements
- support for the ``files`` attribute from the target of input elements
- model children are passed to the Javascript ``mount()`` function
- began to add tests to client-side javascript
- add a ``mountLayoutWithWebSocket`` function to ``idom-client-react``

and breaking changes, the most significant of which are:

- Refactor existing server implementations as functions adhering to a protocol. This
  greatly simplified much of the code responsible for setting up servers and avoids
  the use of inheritance.
- Switch to a monorepo-style structure for Javascript enabling a greater separation of
  concerns and common workspace scripts in ``package.json``.
- Use a ``loadImportSource()`` function instead of trying to infer the path to dynamic
  modules which was brittle and inflexible. Allowing the specific client implementation
  to discover where "import sources" are located means ``idom-client-react`` doesn't
  need to try and devise a solution that will work for all cases. The fallout from this
  change is the addition of `importSource.sourceType` which, for the moment can either
  be ``"NAME"`` or ``"URL"`` where the former indicates the client is expected to know
  where to find a module of that name, and the latter should (usually) be passed on to
  ``import()``


**Issues Fixed:**

- :issue:`324` (partially resolved)
- :issue:`375`

**Highlighted Commits:**

- xfail due to bug in Python - :commit:`fee49a7`

0.27.0
------

Introduces changes to the interface for custom Javascript components. This now allows
JS modules to export a ``mount(element, component, props)`` function which can be used
to bind new elements to the DOM instead of using the application's own React instance
and specifying React as a peer dependency. This avoids a wide variety of potential
issues with implementing custom components and opens up the possibility for a wider
variety of component implementations.

**Highlighted Commits:**

- modules with mount func should not have children - :commit:`94d006c`
- limit to flask<2.0 - :commit:`e7c11d0`
- federate modules with mount function - :commit:`bf63a62`


0.26.0
------

A collection of minor fixes and changes that, as a whole, add up to something requiring
a minor release. The most significant addition is a fix for situations where a
``Layout`` can raise an error when a component whose state has been delete is rendered.
This occurs when element has been unmounted, but a latent event tells the layout it
should be updated. For example, when a user clicks a button rapidly, and the resulting
update deletes the original button.

**Highlighted Commits:**

- only one attr dict in vdom constructor - :commit:`555086a`
- remove Option setter/getter with current property - :commit:`2627f79`
- add cli command to show options - :commit:`c9e6869`
- check component has model state before render - :commit:`6a50d56`
- rename daemon to run_in_thread + misc - :commit:`417b687`

0.25.0
------

Completely refactors :ref:`Layout Dispatchers <Layout Dispatcher>` by switching from a
class-based approach to one that leverages pure functions. While the logic itself isn't
any simpler, it was easier to implement, and now hopefully understand, correctly. This
conversion was motivated by several bugs that had cropped up related to improper usage
of ``anyio``.

**Issues Fixed:**

- :issue:`330`
- :issue:`298`

**Highlighted Commits:**

- improve docs + simplify multiview - :commit:`4129b60`
- require anyio>=3.0 - :commit:`24aed28`
- refactor dispatchers - :commit:`ce8e060`

0.24.0
------

This release contains an update that allows components and elements to have "identity".
That is, their state can be preserved across updates. Before this point, only the state
for the component at the root of an update was preserved. Now though, the state for any
component and element with a ``key`` that is unique amongst its siblings, will be
preserved so long as this is also true for parent elements/components within the scope
of the current update. Thus, only when the key of the element or component changes will
its state do the same.

In a future update, the default key for all elements and components will be its index
with respect to its siblings in the layout. The
:attr:`~idom.config.IDOM_FEATURE_INDEX_AS_DEFAULT_KEY` feature flag has been introduced
to allow users to enable this behavior early.

**Highlighted Commits:**

- add feature flag for default key behavior - :commit:`42ee01c`
- use unique object instead of index as default key - :commit:`5727ab4`
- make HookCatcher/StaticEventHandlers testing utils - :commit:`1abfd76`
