v1.0.0-a1
---------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2023-01-28*

**Changed**

- :pull:`841` - Revamped element constructor interface. Now instead of passing a
  dictionary of attributes to element constructors, attributes are declared using
  keyword arguments. For example, instead of writing:

  .. code-block::

      html.div({"className": "some-class"}, "some", "text")

  You now should write:

  .. code-block::

      html.div("some", "text", class_name="some-class")

  .. note::

    All attributes are written using ``snake_case``.

  In conjunction, with these changes, ReactPy now supplies a command line utility that
  makes a "best effort" attempt to automatically convert code to the new API. Usage of
  this utility is as follows:

  .. code-block:: bash

      reactpy update-html-usages [PATHS]

  Where ``[PATHS]`` is any number of directories or files that should be rewritten.

  .. warning::

    After running this utility, code comments and formatting may have been altered. It's
    recommended that you run a code formatting tool like `Black
    <https://github.com/psf/black>`__ and manually review and replace any comments that
    may have been moved.

**Fixed**

- :issue:`755` - unification of component and VDOM constructor interfaces. See above.


v0.44.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2023-01-27*

**Deprecated**

- :pull:`876` - ``reactpy.widgets.hotswap``. The function has no clear uses outside of some
  internal applications. For this reason it has been deprecated.

**Removed**

- :pull:`886` - Ability to access element value from events via `event['value']` key.
  Instead element value should be accessed via `event['target']['value']`. Originally
  deprecated in :ref:`v0.34.0`.
- :pull:`886` - old misspelled option ``reactpy.config.REACTPY_WED_MODULES_DIR``. Originally
  deprecated in :ref:`v0.36.1`.


v0.43.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2023-01-09*

**Deprecated**

- :pull:`870` - ``ComponentType.should_render()``. This method was implemented based on
  reading the React/Preact source code. As it turns out though it seems like it's mostly
  a vestige from the fact that both these libraries still support class-based
  components. The ability for components to not render also caused several bugs.

**Fixed**

- :issue:`846` - Nested context does no update value if outer context should not render.
- :issue:`847` - Detached model state on render of context consumer if unmounted and
  context value does not change.


v0.42.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-12-02*

**Added**

- :pull:`835` - Ability to customize the ``<head>`` element of ReactPy's built-in client.
- :pull:`835` - ``vdom_to_html`` utility function.
- :pull:`843` - Ability to subscribe to changes that are made to mutable options.
- :pull:`832` - ``del_html_head_body_transform`` to remove ``<html>``, ``<head>``, and ``<body>`` while preserving children.
- :pull:`699` - Support for form element serialization

**Fixed**

- :issue:`582` - ``REACTPY_DEBUG_MODE`` is now mutable and can be changed at runtime
- :pull:`832` - Fix ``html_to_vdom`` improperly removing ``<html>``, ``<head>``, and ``<body>`` nodes.

**Removed**

- :pull:`832` - Removed ``reactpy.html.body`` as it is currently unusable due to technological limitations, and thus not needed.
- :pull:`840` - remove ``REACTPY_FEATURE_INDEX_AS_DEFAULT_KEY`` option
- :pull:`835` - ``serve_static_files`` option from backend configuration

**Deprecated**

- :commit:`8f3785b` - Deprecated ``module_from_template``

v0.41.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-11-01*

**Changed**

- :pull:`823` - The hooks ``use_location`` and ``use_scope`` are no longer
  implementation specific and are now available as top-level imports. Instead of each
  backend defining these hooks, backends establish a ``ConnectionContext`` with this
  information.
- :pull:`824` - ReactPy's built-in backend server now expose the following routes:

  - ``/_reactpy/assets/<file-path>``
  - ``/_reactpy/stream/<path>``
  - ``/_reactpy/modules/<file-path>``
  - ``/<prefix>/<path>``

  This should allow the browser to cache static resources. Even if your ``url_prefix``
  is ``/_reactpy``, your app should still work as expected. Though if you're using
  ``reactpy-router``, ReactPy's server routes will always take priority.
- :pull:`824` - Backend implementations now strip any URL prefix in the pathname for
  ``use_location``.
- :pull:`827` - ``use_state`` now returns a named tuple with ``value`` and ``set_value``
  fields. This is convenient for adding type annotations if the initial state value is
  not the same as the values you might pass to the state setter. Where previously you
  might have to do something like:

  .. code-block::

      value: int | None = None
      value, set_value = use_state(value)

  Now you can annotate your state using the ``State`` class:

  .. code-block::

      state: State[int | None] = use_state(None)

      # access value and setter
      state.value
      state.set_value

      # can still destructure if you need to
      value, set_value = state

**Added**

- :pull:`823` - There is a new ``use_connection`` hook which returns a ``Connection``
  object. This ``Connection`` object contains a ``location`` and ``scope``, along with
  a ``carrier`` which is unique to each backend implementation.


v0.40.2
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-09-13*

**Changed**

- :pull:`809` - Avoid the use of JSON patch for diffing models.


v0.40.1
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-09-11*

**Fixed**

- :issue:`806` - Child models after a component fail to render


v0.40.0 (yanked)
----------------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-08-13*

**Fixed**

- :issue:`777` - Fix edge cases where ``html_to_vdom`` can fail to convert HTML
- :issue:`789` - Conditionally rendered components cannot use contexts
- :issue:`773` - Use strict equality check for text, numeric, and binary types in hooks
- :issue:`801` - Accidental mutation of old model causes invalid JSON Patch

**Changed**

- :pull:`123` - set default timeout on playwright page for testing
- :pull:`787` - Track contexts in hooks as state
- :pull:`787` - remove non-standard ``name`` argument from ``create_context``

**Added**

- :pull:`123` - ``asgiref`` as a dependency
- :pull:`795` - ``lxml`` as a dependency


v0.39.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-06-20*

**Fixed**

- :pull:`763` - ``No module named 'reactpy.server'`` from ``reactpy.run``
- :pull:`749` - Setting appropriate MIME type for web modules in `sanic` server implementation

**Changed**

- :pull:`763` - renamed various:

  - ``reactpy.testing.server -> reactpy.testing.backend``
  - ``ServerFixture -> BackendFixture``
  - ``DisplayFixture.server -> DisplayFixture.backend``

- :pull:`765` - ``exports_default`` parameter is removed from ``module_from_template``.

**Added**

- :pull:`765` - ability to specify versions with module templates (e.g.
  ``module_from_template("react@^17.0.0", ...)``).


v0.38.1
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-04-15*

**Fixed**

- `reactive-python/reactpy-jupyter#22 <https://github.com/reactive-python/reactpy-jupyter/issues/22>`__ -
  a missing file extension was causing a problem with WebPack.


v0.38.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-04-15*

No changes.


v0.38.0-a4
----------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-04-15*

**Added**

- :pull:`733` - ``use_debug_value`` hook

**Changed**

- :pull:`733` - renamed ``assert_reactpy_logged`` testing util to ``assert_reactpy_did_log``


v0.38.0-a3
----------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-04-15*

**Changed**

- :pull:`730` - Layout context management is not async


v0.38.0-a2
----------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-04-14*

**Added**

- :pull:`721` - Implement ``use_location()`` hook. Navigating to any route below the
  root of the application will be reflected in the ``location.pathname``. This operates
  in concert with how ReactPy's configured routes have changed. This will ultimately work
  towards resolving :issue:`569`.

**Changed**

- :pull:`721` - The routes ReactPy configures on apps have changed

  .. code-block:: text

      prefix/_api/modules/*    web modules
      prefix/_api/stream       websocket endpoint
      prefix/*                 client react app

  This means that ReactPy's client app is available at any route below the configured
  ``url_prefix`` besides ``prefix/_api``. The ``_api`` route will likely remain a route
  which is reserved by ReactPy. The route navigated to below the ``prefix`` will be shown
  in ``use_location``.

- :pull:`721` - ReactPy's client now uses Preact instead of React

- :pull:`726` - Renamed ``reactpy.server`` to ``reactpy.backend``. Other references to "server
  implementations" have been renamed to "backend implementations" throughout the
  documentation and code.

**Removed**

- :pull:`721` - ``redirect_root`` server option


v0.38.0-a1
----------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-03-27*

**Changed**

- :pull:`703` - How ReactPy integrates with servers. ``reactpy.run`` no longer accepts an app
  instance to discourage use outside of testing. ReactPy's server implementations now
  provide ``configure()`` functions instead. ``reactpy.testing`` has been completely
  reworked in order to support async web drivers
- :pull:`703` - ``PerClientStateServer`` has been functionally replaced by ``configure``

**Added**

- :issue:`669` - Access to underlying server requests via contexts

**Removed**

- :issue:`669` - Removed ``reactpy.widgets.multiview`` since basic routing view ``use_scope`` is
  now possible as well as all ``SharedClientStateServer`` implementations.

**Fixed**

- :issue:`591` - ReactPy's test suite no longer uses sync web drivers
- :issue:`678` - Updated Sanic requirement to ``>=21``
- :issue:`657` - How we advertise ``reactpy.run``


v0.37.2
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-03-27*

**Changed**

- :pull:`701` - The name of ``proto`` modules to ``types`` and added a top level
  ``reactpy.types`` module

**Fixed**

- :pull:`716` - A typo caused ReactPy to use the insecure ``ws`` web-socket protocol on
  pages loaded with ``https`` instead of the secure ``wss`` protocol


v0.37.1
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-03-05*

v0.37.1-a2
----------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-03-02*

v0.36.3
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-02-18*

Misc bug fixes along with a minor improvement that allows components to return ``None``
to render nothing.

**Closed Issues**

- All child states wiped upon any child key change - :issue:`652`
- Allow NoneType returns within components - :issue:`538`

**Merged Pull Requests**

- fix #652 - :pull:`672`
- Fix 663 - :pull:`667`


v0.36.2
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-02-02*

Hot fix for newly introduced ``DeprecatedOption``:

- :commit:`c146dfb264cbc3d2256a62efdfe9ccf62c795b01`


v0.36.1
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-02-02*

Includes bug fixes and renames the configuration option ``REACTPY_WED_MODULES_DIR`` to
``REACTPY_WEB_MODULES_DIR`` with a corresponding deprecation warning.

**Closed Issues**

- Fix Key Error When Cleaning Up Event Handlers - :issue:`640`
- Update Script Tag Behavior - :issue:`628`

**Merged Pull Requests**

- mark old state as None if unmounting - :pull:`641`
- rename REACTPY_WED_MODULES_DIR to REACTPY_WEB_MODULES_DIR - :pull:`638`


v0.36.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-01-30*

This release includes an important fix for errors produced after :pull:`623` was merged.
In addition there is not a new ``http.script`` element which can behave similarly to a
standard HTML ``<script>`` or, if no attributes are given, operate similarly to an
effect. If no attributes are given, and when the script evaluates to a function, that
function will be called the first time it is mounted and any time the content of the
script is subsequently changed. If the function then returns another function, that
returned function will be called when the script is removed from the view, or just
before the content of the script changes.

**Closed Issues**

- State mismatch during component update - :issue:`629`
- Implement a script tag - :issue:`544`

**Pull Requests**

- make scripts behave more like normal html script element - :pull:`632`
- Fix state mismatch during component update - :pull:`631`
- implement script element - :pull:`617`


v0.35.4
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-01-27*

Keys for elements at the root of a component were not being tracked. Thus key changes
for elements at the root did not trigger unmounts.

**Closed Issues**

- Change Key of Parent Element Does Not Unmount Children - :issue:`622`

**Pull Requests**

- fix issue with key-based identity - :pull:`623`


v0.35.3
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-01-27*

As part of :pull:`614`, elements which changed type were not deeply unmounted. This
behavior is probably undesirable though since the state for children of the element
in question would persist (probably unexpectedly).

**Pull Requests**

- Always deeply unmount - :pull:`620`


v0.35.2
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-01-26*

This release includes several bug fixes. The most significant of which is the ability to
change the type of an element in the try (i.e. to and from being a component) without
getting an error. Originally the errors were introduced because it was though changing
element type would not be desirable. This was not the case though - swapping types
turns out to be quite common and useful.

**Closed Issues**

- Allow Children with the Same Key to Vary in Type - :issue:`613`
- Client Always Looks for Server at "/"  - :issue:`611`
- Web modules get double file extensions with v0.35.x - :issue:`605`

**Pull Requests**

- allow elements with the same key to change type - :pull:`614`
- make connection to websocket relative path - :pull:`612`
- fix double file extension - :pull:`606`


v0.35.1
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-01-18*

Re-add accidentally deleted ``py.typed`` file to distribution. See `PEP-561
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/#packaging-type-information>`__ for info on
this marker file.


v0.35.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2022-01-18*

The highlight of this release is that the default :ref:`"key" <Organizing Items With
Keys>` of all elements will be their index amongst their neighbors. Previously this
behavior could be engaged by setting ``REACTPY_FEATURE_INDEX_AS_DEFAULT_KEY=1`` when
running ReactPy. In this release though, you will need to explicitly turn off this feature
(i.e. ``=0``) to return to the old behavior. With this change, some may notice
additional error logs which warn that:

.. code-block:: text

  Key not specified for child in list ...

This is saying is that an element or component which was created in a list does not have
a unique ``key``. For more information on how to mitigate this warning refer to the docs
on :ref:`Organizing Items With Keys`.

**Closed Issues**

- Support Starlette Server - :issue:`588`
- Fix unhandled case in module_from_template - :issue:`584`
- Hide "Children" within REACTPY_DEBUG_MODE key warnings - :issue:`562`
- Bug in Element Key Identity - :issue:`556`
- Add iFrame to reactpy.html - :issue:`542`
- Create a use_linked_inputs widget instead of Input - :issue:`475`
- React warning from module_from_template - :issue:`440`
- Use Index as Default Key - :issue:`351`

**Pull Requests**

- add ``use_linked_inputs`` - :pull:`593`
- add starlette server implementation - :pull:`590`
- Log on web module replacement instead of error - :pull:`586`
- Make Index Default Key - :pull:`579`
- reduce log spam from missing keys in children - :pull:`564`
- fix bug in element key identity - :pull:`563`
- add more standard html elements - :pull:`554`


v0.34.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-12-16*

This release contains a variety of minor fixes and improvements which came out of
rewriting the documentation. The most significant of these changes is the remove of
target element attributes from the top-level of event data dictionaries. For example,
instead of being able to find the value of an input at ``event["value"]`` it will
instead be found at ``event["target"]["value"]``. For a short period we will issue a
:class:`DeprecationWarning` when target attributes are requested at the top-level of the
event dictionary. As part of this change we also add ``event["currentTarget"]`` and
``event["relatedTarget"]`` keys to the event dictionary as well as a
``event[some_target]["boundingClientRect"]`` where ``some_target`` may be ``"target"``,
``"currentTarget"`` or ``"relatedTarget"``.

**Closed Issues**

- Move target attributes to ``event['target']`` - :issue:`548`

**Pull Requests**

- Correctly Handle Target Event Data - :pull:`550`
- Clean up WS console logging - :pull:`522`
- automatically infer closure arguments - :pull:`520`
- Documentation Rewrite - :pull:`519`
- add option to replace existing when creating a module - :pull:`516`


v0.33.3
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-10-08*

Contains a small number of bug fixes and improvements. The most significant change is
the addition of a warning stating that `REACTPY_FEATURE_INDEX_AS_DEFAULT_KEY=1` will become
the default in a future release. Beyond that, a lesser improvement makes it possible to
use the default export from a Javascript module when calling `module_from_template` by
specifying `exports_default=True` as a parameter. A

**Closed Issues**

- Memory leak in SharedClientStateServer - :issue:`511`
- Cannot use default export in react template - :issue:`502`
- Add warning that element index will be used as the default key in a future release - :issue:`428`

**Pull Requests**

- warn that REACTPY_FEATURE_INDEX_AS_DEFAULT_KEY=1 will be the default - :pull:`515`
- clean up patch queues after exit - :pull:`514`
- Remove Reconnecting WS alert - :pull:`513`
- Fix 502 - :pull:`503`


v0.33.2
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-09-05*

A release to fix a memory leak caused by event handlers that were not being removed
when components updated.

**Closed Issues**

- Non-root component event handlers cause memory leaks - :issue:`510`


v0.33.1
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-09-02*

A hot fix for a regression introduced in ``0.33.0`` where the root element of the layout
could not be updated. See :issue:`498` for more info. A regression test for this will
be introduced in a future release.

**Pull Requests**

- Fix 498 pt1 - :pull:`501`


v0.33.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-09-02*

The most significant fix in this release is for a regression which manifested in
:issue:`480`, :issue:`489`, and :issue:`451` which resulted from an issue in the way
JSON patches were being applied client-side. This was ultimately resolved by
:pull:`490`. While it's difficult to test this without a more thorough Javascript
suite, we added a test that should hopefully catch this in the future by proxy.

The most important breaking change, is yet another which modifies the Custom Javascript
Component interface. We now add a ``create()`` function to the ``bind()`` interface that
allows ReactPy's client to recursively create components from that (and only that) import
source. Prior to this, the interface was given unrendered models for child elements. The
imported module was then responsible for rendering them. This placed a large burden on
the author to understand how to handle these unrendered child models. In addition, in
the React template used by ``module_from_template`` we needed to import a version of
``@reactpy/client`` from the CDN - this had already caused some issues where the
template required a version of ``@reactpy/client`` in the which had not been released
yet.

**Closed Issues**

- Client-side error in mount-01d35dc3.js - :issue:`489`
- Style Cannot Be Updated - :issue:`480`
- Displaying error messages in the client via `__error__` tag can leak secrets - :issue:`454`
- Examples broken in docs  - :issue:`451`
- Rework docs landing page - :issue:`446`
- eventHandlers should be a mapping of generic callables - :issue:`423`
- Allow customization of built-in ReactPy client - :issue:`253`

**Pull Requests**

- move VdomDict and VdomJson to proto - :pull:`492`
- only send error info in debug mode - :pull:`491`
- correctly apply client-side JSON patch - :pull:`490`
- add script to set version of all packages in ReactPy - :pull:`483`
- Pass import source to bind - :pull:`482`
- Do not mutate client-side model - :pull:`481`
- assume import source children come from same source - :pull:`479`
- make an EventHandlerType protocol - :pull:`476`
- Update issue form - :pull:`471`


v0.32.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-08-20*

In addition to a variety of bug fixes and other minor improvements, there's a breaking
change to the custom component interface - instead of exporting multiple functions that
render custom components, we simply expect a single ``bind()`` function.
binding function then must return an object with a ``render()`` and ``unmount()``
function. This change was made in order to better support the rendering of child models.
See :ref:`Custom JavaScript Components` for details on the new interface.

v0.31.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-07-14*

The :class:`~reactpy.core.layout.Layout` is now a prototype, and ``Layout.update`` is no
longer a public API. This is combined with a much more significant refactor of the
underlying rendering logic.

The biggest issue that has been resolved relates to the relationship between
:class:`~reactpy.core.hooks.LifeCycleHook` and ``Layout``. Previously, the
``LifeCycleHook`` accepted a layout instance in its constructor and called
``Layout.update``. Additionally, the ``Layout`` would manipulate the
``LifeCycleHook.component`` attribute whenever the component instance changed after a
render. The former behavior leads to a non-linear code path that's a touch to follow.
The latter behavior is the most egregious design issue since there's absolutely no local
indication that the component instance can be swapped out (not even a comment).

The new refactor no longer binds component or layout instances to a ``LifeCycleHook``.
Instead, the hook simply receives an un-parametrized callback that can be triggered to
schedule a render. While some error logs lose clarity (since we can't say what component
caused them). This change precludes a need for the layout to ever mutate the hook.

To accommodate this change, the internal representation of the layout's state had to
change. Previously, a class-based approach was take, where methods of the state-holding
classes were meant to handle all use cases. Now we rely much more heavily on very simple
(and mostly static) data structures that have purpose built constructor functions that
much more narrowly address each use case.

After these refactors, ``ComponentTypes`` no longer needs a unique ``id`` attribute.
Instead, a unique ID is generated internally which is associated with the
``LifeCycleState``, not component instances since they are inherently transient.

**Pull Requests**

- fix #419 and #412 - :pull:`422`


v0.30.1
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-07-13*

Removes the usage of the :func:`id` function for generating unique ideas because there
were situations where the IDs bound to the lifetime of an object are problematic. Also
adds a warning :class:`Deprecation` warning to render functions that include the
parameter ``key``. It's been decided that allowing ``key`` to be used in this way can
lead to confusing bugs.

**Pull Requests**

- warn if key is param of component render function - :pull:`421`
- fix :issue:`417` and :issue:`413` - :pull:`418`
- add changelog entry for :ref:`v0.30.0` - :pull:`415`


v0.30.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-06-28*

With recent changes to the custom component interface, it's now possible to remove all
runtime reliance on NPM. Doing so has many virtuous knock-on effects:

1. Removal of large chunks of code
2. Greatly simplifies how users dynamically experiment with React component libraries,
   because their usage no longer requires a build step. Instead they can be loaded in
   the browser from a CDN that distributes ESM modules.
3. The built-in client code needs to make fewer assumption about where static resources
   are located, and as a result, it's also easier to coordinate the server and client
   code.
4. Alternate client implementations benefit from this simplicity. Now, it's possible to
   install @reactpy/client normally and write a ``loadImportSource()`` function that
   looks for route serving the contents of `REACTPY_WEB_MODULES_DIR.`

This change includes large breaking changes:

- The CLI is being removed as it won't be needed any longer
- The `reactpy.client` is being removed in favor of a stripped down ``reactpy.web`` module
- The `REACTPY_CLIENT_BUILD_DIR` config option will no longer exist and a new
  ``REACTPY_WEB_MODULES_DIR`` which only contains dynamically linked web modules. While
  this new directory's location is configurable, it is meant to be transient and should
  not be re-used across sessions.

The new ``reactpy.web`` module takes a simpler approach to constructing import sources and
expands upon the logic for resolving imports by allowing exports from URLs to be
discovered too. Now, that ReactPy isn't using NPM to dynamically install component
libraries ``reactpy.web`` instead creates JS modules from template files and links them
into ``REACTPY_WEB_MODULES_DIR``. These templates ultimately direct the browser to load the
desired library from a CDN.

v0.29.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-06-20*

Contains breaking changes, the most significant of which are:

- Moves the runtime client build directory to a "user data" directory rather a directory
  where ReactPy's code was installed. This has the advantage of not requiring write
  permissions to rebuild the client if ReactPy was installed globally rather than in a
  virtual environment.
- The custom JS component interface has been reworked to expose an API similar to
  the ``createElement``, ``render``, ``unmountComponentAtNode`` functions from React.

**Issues Fixed:**

- :issue:`375`
- :issue:`394`
- :issue:`401`

**Highlighted Commits:**

- add try/except around event handling - :commit:`f2bf589`
- do not call find_builtin_server_type at import time - :commit:`e29745e`
- import default from react/reactDOM/fast-json-patch - :commit:`74c8a34`

- change shared to update_on_change - :commit:`6c09a86`
- rework js module interface + fix docs - :commit:`699cc66`
- correctly serialize File object - :commit:`a2398dc`


v0.28.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-06-01*

Includes a wide variety of improvements:

- support ``currentTime`` attr of audio/video elements
- support for the ``files`` attribute from the target of input elements
- model children are passed to the Javascript ``mount()`` function
- began to add tests to client-side javascript
- add a ``mountLayoutWithWebSocket`` function to ``@reactpy/client``

and breaking changes, the most significant of which are:

- Refactor existing server implementations as functions adhering to a protocol. This
  greatly simplified much of the code responsible for setting up servers and avoids
  the use of inheritance.
- Switch to a monorepo-style structure for Javascript enabling a greater separation of
  concerns and common workspace scripts in ``package.json``.
- Use a ``loadImportSource()`` function instead of trying to infer the path to dynamic
  modules which was brittle and inflexible. Allowing the specific client implementation
  to discover where "import sources" are located means ``@reactpy/client`` doesn't
  need to try and devise a solution that will work for all cases. The fallout from this
  change is the addition of `importSource.sourceType` which, for the moment can either
  be ``"NAME"`` or ``"URL"`` where the former indicates the client is expected to know
  where to find a module of that name, and the latter should (usually) be passed on to
  ``import()``


**Issues Fixed:**

- :issue:`324` (partially resolved)
- :issue:`375`

**Highlighted Commits:**

- xfail due to bug in Python - :commit:`fee49a7`

v0.27.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-05-14*

Introduces changes to the interface for custom Javascript components. This now allows
JS modules to export a ``mount(element, component, props)`` function which can be used
to bind new elements to the DOM instead of using the application's own React instance
and specifying React as a peer dependency. This avoids a wide variety of potential
issues with implementing custom components and opens up the possibility for a wider
variety of component implementations.

**Highlighted Commits:**

- modules with mount func should not have children - :commit:`94d006c`
- limit to flask<2.0 - :commit:`e7c11d0`
- federate modules with mount function - :commit:`bf63a62`


v0.26.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-05-07*

A collection of minor fixes and changes that, as a whole, add up to something requiring
a minor release. The most significant addition is a fix for situations where a
``Layout`` can raise an error when a component whose state has been delete is rendered.
This occurs when element has been unmounted, but a latent event tells the layout it
should be updated. For example, when a user clicks a button rapidly, and the resulting
update deletes the original button.

**Highlighted Commits:**

- only one attr dict in vdom constructor - :commit:`555086a`
- remove Option setter/getter with current property - :commit:`2627f79`
- add cli command to show options - :commit:`c9e6869`
- check component has model state before render - :commit:`6a50d56`
- rename daemon to run_in_thread + misc - :commit:`417b687`


v0.25.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-04-30*

Completely refactors layout dispatcher by switching from a class-based approach to one
that leverages pure functions. While the logic itself isn't any simpler, it was easier
to implement, and now hopefully understand, correctly. This conversion was motivated by
several bugs that had cropped up related to improper usage of ``anyio``.

**Issues Fixed:**

- :issue:`330`
- :issue:`298`

**Highlighted Commits:**

- improve docs + simplify multi-view - :commit:`4129b60`
- require anyio>=3.0 - :commit:`24aed28`
- refactor dispatchers - :commit:`ce8e060`


v0.24.0
-------
:octicon:`milestone` *released on 2021-04-18*

This release contains an update that allows components and elements to have "identity".
That is, their state can be preserved across updates. Before this point, only the state
for the component at the root of an update was preserved. Now though, the state for any
component and element with a ``key`` that is unique amongst its siblings, will be
preserved so long as this is also true for parent elements/components within the scope
of the current update. Thus, only when the key of the element or component changes will
its state do the same.

In a future update, the default key for all elements and components will be its index
with respect to its siblings in the layout. The
:attr:`~reactpy.config.REACTPY_FEATURE_INDEX_AS_DEFAULT_KEY` feature flag has been introduced
to allow users to enable this behavior early.

**Highlighted Commits:**

- add feature flag for default key behavior - :commit:`42ee01c`
- use unique object instead of index as default key - :commit:`5727ab4`
- make HookCatcher/StaticEventHandlers testing utils - :commit:`1abfd76`
