Dangers of Mutability
=====================

While state can hold any type of value, you should be careful to avoid directly
modifying objects that you declare as state with IDOM. In other words, you must not
:ref:`"mutate" <What is a Mutation>` values which are held as state. Rather, to change
these values you should use new ones or create copies.


.. _what is a mutation:

What is a Mutation?
-------------------

In Python, values may be either "mutable" or "immutable". Mutable objects are those
whose underlying data can be changed after they are created, and immutable objects are
those which cannot. A "mutation" then, is the act of changing the underlying data of a
mutable value. In particular, a :class:`dict` is a mutable type of value. In the code
below, an initially empty dictionary is created. Then, a key and value is added to it:

.. code-block::

    x = {}
    x["a"] = 1
    assert x == {"a": 1}

This is different from something like a :class:`str` which is immutable. Instead of
modifying the underlying data of an existing value, a new one must be created to
facilitate change:

.. code-block::

    x = "Hello"
    y = x + " world!"
    assert x is not y

.. note::

    In Python, the ``is`` and ``is not`` operators check whether two values are
    identitcal. This `is distinct
    <https://realpython.com/python-is-identity-vs-equality>`__ from checking whether two
    values are equivalent with the ``==`` or ``!=`` operators.

Thus far, all the values we've been working with have been immutable. These include
:class:`int`, :class:`float`, :class:`str`, and :class:`bool` values. As a result, we've
have not had to consider the consiquences of mutations.


.. _Why Avoid Mutation:

Why Avoid Mutation?
-------------------

Unfortunately, IDOM does not understand that when a value is mutated, it may have
changed. As a result, mutating values will not trigger re-renders. Thus, you must be
careful to avoid mutation whenever you want IDOM to re-render a component. For example,
the intention of the code below is to make the red dot move when you touch or hover over
the preview area. However it doesn't - the dot remains stationary:

.. idom:: _examples/moving_dot_broken

The problem is with this section of code:

.. literalinclude:: _examples/moving_dot_broken.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 13-14
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 13

This code mutates the ``position`` dictionary from the prior render instead of using the
state variable's associated state setter. Without calling setter IDOM has no idea that
the variable's data has been modified. While it can be possible to get away with
mutating state variables, it's highly dicsouraged. Doing so can cause strange and
unpredictable behavior. As a result, you should always treat the data within a state
variable as immutable.

To actually trigger a render we need to call the state setter. To do that we'll assign
it to ``set_position`` instead of the unused ``_`` variable we have above. Then we can
call it by passing a *new* dictionary with the values for the next render. Notice how,
by making these alterations to the code, that the dot now follows your pointer when
you touch or hover over the preview:

.. idom:: _examples/moving_dot


.. dropdown:: Local mutation can be alright
    :color: info
    :animate: fade-in

    While code like this causes problems:

    .. code-block::

        position["x"] = event["clientX"] - outer_div_bounds["x"]
        position["y"] = event["clientY"] - outer_div_bounds["y"]

    It's ok if you mutate a fresh dictionary that you have *just* created before calling
    the state setter:

    .. code-block::

        new_position = {}
        new_position["x"] = event["clientX"] - outer_div_bounds["x"]
        new_position["y"] = event["clientY"] - outer_div_bounds["y"]
        set_position(new_position)

    It's actually nearly equivalent to having written:

    .. code-block::

        set_position(
            {
                "x": event["clientX"] - outer_div_bounds["x"],
                "y": event["clientY"] - outer_div_bounds["y"],
            }
        )

    Mutation is only a problem when you change data assigned to existing state
    variables. Mutating an object you’ve just created is okay because no other code
    references it yet. Changing it isn’t going to accidentally impact something that
    depends on it. This is called a “local mutation.” You can even do local mutation
    while rendering. Very convenient and completely okay!


Working with Dictionaries
-------------------------

Below are some ways to update dictionaries without mutating them:

.. card:: Updating Items
    :link: updating-dictionary-items
    :link-type: ref

    Avoid using item assignment, ``dict.update``, or ``dict.setdefault``. Instead try
    the strategies below:

    .. code-block::

        {**d, "key": value}

        # Python >= 3.9
        d | {"key": value}

        # Equivalent to dict.setdefault()
        {"key": value, **d}

.. card:: Removing Items
    :link: removing-dictionary-items
    :link-type: ref

    Avoid using item deletion or ``dict.pop``. Instead try the strategies below:

    .. code-block::

        {
            k: v
            for k, v in d.items()
            if k != key
        }

        # Better for removing multiple items
        {
            k: d[k]
            for k in set(d).difference([key])
        }

Updating Dictionary Items
.........................

.. grid:: 1 1 1 2
    :gutter: 1

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-danger:`Avoid`

        .. code-block::

            d[key] = value

            d.update({key: value})

            d.setdefault(key, value)

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-info:`Prefer`

        .. code-block::

            {**d, key: value}

            # Python >= 3.9
            d | {key: value}

            # Equivalent to setdefault()
            {key: value, **d}

As we saw in an :ref:`earlier example <why avoid mutation>`, instead of mutating
dictionaries to update their items you should instead create a copy that contains the
desired changes.

However, sometimes you may only want to update some of the information in a dictionary
which is held by a state variable. Consider the case below where we have a form for
updating user information with a preview of the currently entered data. We can
accomplish this using `"unpacking" <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/>`__ with
the ``**`` syntax:

.. idom:: _examples/dict_update


.. _removing-dictionary-items:

Removing Dictionary Items
.........................

.. grid:: 1 1 1 2
    :gutter: 1

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-danger:`Avoid`

        .. code-block::

            del d[key]

            d.pop(key)

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-info:`Prefer`

        .. code-block::

            {
                k: v
                for k, v in d.items()
                if k != key
            }

            # Better for removing multiple items
            {
                k: d[k]
                for k in set(d).difference([key])
            }

This scenario doesn't come up very frequently. When it does though, the best way to
remove items from dictionaries is to create a copy of the original, but with a filtered
set of keys. One way to do this is with a dictionary comprehension. The example below
shows an interface where you're able to enter a new term and definition. Once added,
you can click a delete button to remove the term and definition:

.. idom:: _examples/dict_remove


Working with Lists
------------------

Below are some ways to update lists without mutating them:

.. card:: Inserting Items
    :link: inserting-list-items
    :link-type: ref

    Avoid using ``list.append``, ``list.extend``, and ``list.insert``. Instead try the
    strategies below:

    .. code-block::

        [*l, value]

        l + [value]

        l + values

        l[:index] + [value] + l[index:]

.. card:: Removing Items
    :link: removing-list-items
    :link-type: ref

    Avoid using item deletion or ``list.pop``. Instead try the strategy below:

    .. code-block::

        l[:index - 1] + l[index:]

.. card:: Replacing Items
    :link: replacing-list-items
    :link-type: ref

    Avoid using item  or slice assignment. Instead try the strategies below:

    .. code-block::

        l[:index] + [value] + l[index + 1:]

        l[:start] + values + l[end + 1:]

.. card:: Re-ordering Items
    :link: re-ordering-list-items
    :link-type: ref

    Avoid using ``list.sort`` or ``list.reverse``. Instead try the strategies below:

    .. code-block::

        list(sorted(l))

        list(reversed(l))


----


.. _inserting-list-items:

Inserting List Items
....................

.. grid:: 1 1 1 2

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-danger:`Avoid`

        .. code-block::

            l.append(value)

            l.extend(values)

            l.insert(index, value)

            # Adding a list "in-place" mutates!
            l += [value]

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-info:`Prefer`

        .. code-block::

            [*l, value]

            l + [value]

            l + values

            l[:index] + [value] + l[index:]

Instead of mutating a list to add items to it, we need to create a new list which has
the items we want to append instead. There are several ways to do this for one or more
values however it's often simplest to use `"unpacking"
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/>`__ with the ``*`` syntax.

.. idom:: _examples/list_insert


.. _removing-list-items:

Removing List Items
...................

.. grid:: 1 1 1 2

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-danger:`Avoid`

        .. code-block::

            del l[index]

            l.pop(index)

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-info:`Prefer`

        .. code-block::

            l[:index] + l[index + 1:]

Unfortunately, the syntax for creating a copy of a list with one of its items removed is
not quite as clean. You must select the portion the list prior to the item which should
be removed (``l[:index]``) and the portion after the item (``l[index + 1:]``) and add
them together:

.. idom:: _examples/list_remove


.. _replacing-list-items:

Replacing List Items
....................

.. grid:: 1 1 1 2

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-danger:`Avoid`

        .. code-block::

            l[index] = value

            l[start:end] = values

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-info:`Prefer`

        .. code-block::

            l[:index] + [value] + l[index + 1:]

            l[:start] + values + l[end + 1:]

In a similar manner to :ref:`removing list items`, to replace an item in a list, you
must select the portion before and after the item in question. But this time, instead
of adding those two selections together, you must insert that values you want to replace
between them:

.. idom:: _examples/list_replace


.. _re-ordering-list-items:

Re-ordering List Items
......................

.. grid:: 1 1 1 2

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-danger:`Avoid`

        .. code-block::

            l.sort()

            l.reverse()

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-info:`Prefer`

        .. code-block::

            list(sorted(l))

            list(reversed(l))

There are many different ways that list items could be re-ordered, but two of the most
common are reversing or sorting items. Instead of calling the associated methods on a
list object, you should use the builtin functions :func:`sorted` and :func:`reversed`
and pass the resulting iterator into the :class:`list` constructor to create a sorted
or reversed copy of the given list:

.. idom:: _examples/list_re_order


Working with Sets
-----------------

Below are ways to update sets without mutating them:

.. card:: Adding Items
    :link: adding-set-items
    :link-type: ref

    Avoid using item assignment, ``set.add`` or ``set.update``. Instead try the
    strategies below:

    .. code-block::

        s.union({value})

        s.union(values)

.. card:: Removing Items
    :link: removing-set-items
    :link-type: ref

    Avoid using item deletion or ``dict.pop``. Instead try the strategies below:

    .. code-block::

        s.difference({value})

        s.difference(values)

        s.intersection(values)

.. _adding-set-items:

Adding Set Items
................

.. grid:: 1 1 1 2

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-danger:`Avoid`

        .. code-block::

            s.add(value)
            s |= {value}  # "in-place" operators mutate!

            s.update(values)
            s |= values  # "in-place" operators mutate!

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-info:`Prefer`

        .. code-block::

            s.union({value})
            s | {value}

            s.union(values)
            s | values

Sets have some nice ways for evolving them without requiring mutation. The binary
or operator ``|`` serves as a succinct way to compute the union of two sets. However,
you should be careful to not use an in-place assignment with this operator as that will
(counterintuitively) mutate the original set rather than creating a new one.

.. idom:: _examples/set_update


.. _removing-set-items:

Removing Set Items
..................

.. grid:: 1 1 1 2

    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-danger:`Avoid`

        .. code-block::

            s.remove(value)

            s.difference_update(values)
            s -= values  # "in-place" operators mutate!

            s.symetric_difference_update(values)
            s ^= values  # "in-place" operators mutate!

            s.intersection_update(values)
            s &= values  # "in-place" operators mutate!


    .. grid-item-card:: :bdg-info:`Prefer`

        .. code-block::

            s.difference({value})

            s.difference(values)
            s - values

            s.symetric_difference(values)
            s ^ values

            s.intersection(values)
            s & values

To remove items from sets you can use the various binary operators or their associated
methods to return new sets without mutating them. As before when :ref:`adding set items`
you need to avoid using the inline assignment operators since that will
(counterintuitively) mutate the original set rather than given you a new one:
