Javascript Modules
==================

While IDOM is a great tool for displaying HTML and responding to browser events with
pure Python, there are other projects which already allow you to do this inside
`Jupyter Notebooks <https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Basics.html>`__
or in
`webpages <https://blog.jupyter.org/and-voil%C3%A0-f6a2c08a4a93?gi=54b835a2fcce>`__.
The real power of IDOM comes from its ability to seemlessly leverage the existing
ecosystem of
`React components <https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html>`__.
This can be accomplished in different ways for different reasons:

    *   - :ref:`Dynamically Install Javascript` (requires NPM_)
        - You want to **quickly experiment** with IDOM and the Javascript ecosystem.

    *   - :ref:`Import Javascript Bundles`
        - You want to create polished software that can be **easily shared** with others.


Dynamically Install Javascript
------------------------------

.. warning::

    Before continuing `install NPM`_.

IDOM makes it easy to draft your code when you're in the early stages of development by
using NPM_ to directly install Javascript packages on the fly. In this example we'll be
using the ubiquitous React-based UI framework `Material UI`_ which can be installed
using the ``idom`` CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

    idom install @material-ui/core

Or at runtime with :func:`idom.client.module.install` (this is useful if you're working
in a REPL or Jupyter Notebook):

.. code-block::

    import idom
    material_ui = idom.install("@material-ui/core")
    # or install multiple modules at once
    material_ui, *other_modules = idom.install(["@material-ui/core", ...])

.. note::

    Any standard javascript dependency specifier is allowed here.

Once the package has been succesfully installed, you can import and display the element:

.. example:: material_ui_button_no_action


Passing Props To Javascript
---------------------------

So now that we can install and display a Material UI Button we probably want to make it
do something. Thankfully there's nothing new to learn here, you can pass event handlers
to the button just as you did when :ref:`getting started`. Thus, all we need to do is
add an ``onClick`` handler to the element:

.. example:: material_ui_button_on_click


Import Javascript Bundles
-------------------------

For projects that will be shared with others we recommend bundling your Javascript with
`rollup <https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/>`__ or `webpack <https://webpack.js.org/>`__
into a
`web module <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules>`__.
Once you've done this, you can distribute bundled javascript in your Python package and
integrate it into IDOM by defining :class:`~idom.client.module.Module` objects that
load them from source:

.. code-block::

    import idom
    my_js_package = idom.Module("my-js-package", source_file="/path/to/my/bundle.js")

The core benefit of loading Javascript in this way is that users of your code won't need
NPM_. Rather, they can use ``pip`` to install your Python package without any other build
steps because the bundled Javascript you distributed with it will be symlinked into the
IDOM client at runtime.

.. note::

    In the future IDOM will come with tools to help author Python packages with bundled
    Javascript

With that said, if you just want to see how this all works it might be easiest to
hook in simple a hand-crafted Javascript module. In the example to follow we'll create
a very basic SVG line chart. The catch though is that we are limited to using Javascript
that can run directly in the browser. This means we can't use fancy syntax like
`JSX <https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html>`__ and instead will use
`htm <https://github.com/developit/htm>`__ to simulate JSX in plain Javascript.

.. example:: super_simple_chart


Alternate Client Implementations
--------------------------------

While it's possible to implement a whole-sale replacement for IDOM's built-in client by
adhering to IDOM's :ref:`API <Package API>` and :ref:`Specifications`, the easiest way
to implement a custom client is to create an object that adheres to the
:class:`~idom.client.protocol.ClientImplementation` protocol and update the ``current``
value of the :attr:`~idom.client.protocol.client_implementation` ref. An example of
such an implementation can be seen in
`IDOM's Jupyter Widgets <https://github.com/idom-team/idom-jupyter>`__.

The following describes the client implementation interface:

.. autoclass:: idom.client.protocol.ClientImplementation
    :noindex:
