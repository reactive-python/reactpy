Early Days
----------

IDOM is still young. Be sure to post any `issues`_ you have or contribute by creating a
`pull request`_.


At a Glance
-----------

Let's use IDOM to create a simple slideshow which changes whenever a
user clicks an image:

.. example:: slideshow

Try selecting the "Live Example" tab in the view above and enabling the widget.

Once activated try clicking the displayed image to make it change üñ±Ô∏è

.. note::

    You can display the same thing in a Jupyter Notebook by installing ``idom-jupyter``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install idom-jupyter

    And replacing ``idom.run`` with ``idom_jupyter.run``:

    .. code-block::

        import idom_jupyter
        idom_jupyter.run(Slideshow)
