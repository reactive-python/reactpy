Early Days
----------

IDOM is still young. If you have ideas or find a bug, be sure to post an
`issue`_ or create a `pull request`_. Thanks in advance!


At a Glance
-----------

Let's use IDOM to create a simple slideshow which changes whenever a
user clicks an image:

.. example:: slideshow

You can try out a **Live Example** by selecting the tab and enabling the widget.

Once activated try clicking the displayed image to make it change üñ±Ô∏è

.. note::

    You can display the same thing in a Jupyter Notebook using widgets!

    .. code-block::

        idom.JupyterDisplay(f"https://{host}:{port}")

    For info on working with IDOM in Jupyter see some :ref:`examples <Display Function>`.
