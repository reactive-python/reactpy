Getting Started
===============

Let's look at the example that you may have seen
:ref:`at a glance <At a Glance>` on the homepage:

.. code-block::

    import idom


    @idom.element
    def Slideshow():
        index, set_index = idom.hooks.use_state(0)

        def next_image(event):
            set_index(index + 1)

        return idom.html.img(
            {
                "src": f"https://picsum.photos/800/300?image={index}",
                "style": {"cursor": "pointer"},
                "onClick": next_image,
            }
        )


    host, port = "localhost", 8765
    server = idom.server.sanic.PerClientStateServer(Slideshow)
    server.run(host, port)

Since it's likely a lot to take in at once, we'll break it down piece by piece:

.. code-block::

   @idom.element
   def Slideshow():

The ``idom.element`` decorator creates an :ref:`Element <Stateful Elements>` constructor
whose render function is defined by the `asynchronous function`_ below it. To create
an :class:`~idom.core.element.Element` instance we call ``Slideshow()`` with the same
arguments as its render function. The render function of an Element returns a data
structure that depicts a user interface, or in more technical terms a Document Object
Model (DOM). We call this structural representation of the DOM a `Virtual DOM`__ (VDOM)
- a term familiar to those who work with `ReactJS`_. In the case of ``Slideshow`` it
will return a VDOM representing an image which, when clicked, will change.

__ https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html#what-is-the-virtual-dom

.. code-block::

       index, set_index = idom.hooks.use_state(0)

The :func:`~idom.core.hooks.use_state` function is a :ref:`Hook <Life Cycle Hooks>`.
Calling a Hook inside an Element's render function (one decorated by ``idom.element``)
adds some local state to it. IDOM will preserve the state added by Hooks between calls
to the Element's render function.

The ``use_state`` hook returns two values - the *current* state value and a function
that let's you update that value. In the case of ``Slideshow`` the value of the
``use_state`` hook determines which image is showm to the user, while its update
function allow us to change it. The one required argument of ``use_state`` is the
*initial* state value.

.. note::

    The Hook design pattern has been lifted directly from `React Hooks`_.

.. code-block::

        def next_image(event):
            set_index(index + 1)

The coroutine above will get added as an event handler to the resulting view. When it
responds to an event it will use the update function returned by the ``use_state`` Hook
to change which image is shown to the user. Calling the update function will schedule
the Element to be re-rendered. That is, the Element's render function will be called
again, and its new result will be displayed.

.. note::

    Even handlers like ``next_image`` which respond to user interactions recieve an
    ``event`` dictionary that contains different information depending on the type of
    event that occured. All supported events and the data they contain is listed
    `here`__.

__ https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html

.. code-block::

        return idom.html.img(
            {
                "src": f"https://picsum.photos/800/300?image={index}",
                "style": {"cursor": "pointer"},
                "onClick": next_image,
            }
        )

Finally we come to the end of the ``Slideshow`` body where we return a model for an
``<img/>`` element that draws its image from https://picsum.photos. Our ``next_image``
event handler has been added to the image so that when an ``onClick`` event occurs we
can respond to it. We've also added a little bit of CSS styling to the image so that
when the cursor hoverse over the image it will become a pointer so it appears clickable.
The returned model conforms to the `VDOM mimetype specification`_.

.. code-block::

    host, port = "localhost", 8765
    server = idom.server.sanic.PerClientStateServer(Slideshow)
    server.run(host, port)

These last steps prepare a simple web server that will send the layout of elements
defined in our ``Slideshow`` to the browser and receive any incoming events from the
browser via a websocket. The server has "per client state" because each client that
connects to it will see a fresh view of the layout. If clients should see views with a
common state you can use the ``SharedClientStateServer`` instead.

To display the layout we can navigate to http://localhost:8765/client/index.html or
use the dislay function returns by :func:`~idom.widgets.jupyter.init_display` to show it
in a Jupyter Notebook via a widget. See the :ref:`Examples` section for more info on
the ways to display your layouts.
