IDOM is a powerful Python web framework for building **interactive websites without
needing a single line of Javascript**. It does this by breaking down complex
applications into nestable and reusable chunks of code called
{ref}`"components" <Your First Component>` that allow you to focus on what your
application does rather then how it does it.
