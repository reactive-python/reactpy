# IDOM (Javascript)

The client side of IDOM. This is where raw DOM models are consumed and then turned
into images on the screen. All libraries require React `16.8.2` (the one with
[hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
).

# Early Days

IDOM is still young. If you have ideas or find a bug, be sure to post an
[issue](https://github.com/rmorshea/idom/issues)
or create a
[pull request](https://github.com/rmorshea/idom/pulls).
We need all the help we can get!
