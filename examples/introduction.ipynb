In this case we use it to holds a reference to the `Holder` which is currently filled. Once a new holder should become filled we use the `Var` to sneakily update make the last holder empty."

It's worth noting that not every package will work with IDOM since the packages source must be compilable to ES6 using [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/), many should just work out of the box though. In the following example we display a [Bar Chart](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-bar/) from the [Victory Chart Library](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/) using its default data."

This might be because a package you installed doesn't play well with IDOM, or because you need to create your own custom logic that can only be achieved using client-side Javascript. In the case of Victory, it's actually both - unfortunately Victory's higher level components can't be constructed purely using VDOM in Python in addition to the fact that many of its more complex features require writing custom Javascript hooks. \n",
