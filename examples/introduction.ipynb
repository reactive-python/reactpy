However in order to implement drag and drop we need to `stop_propagation` of an event, and `prevent_default` actions the event takes.

In the drag-and-drop example below we need to keep track of which box is filled and which is not. To do this we use an `idom.Var` a simple utility that holds a reference to an object. In this case we use it to holds a reference to the `Holder` which is currently filled. Once a new holder should become filled we use the `Var` to sneakily update make the last holder empty."
