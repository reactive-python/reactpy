ReactPy is a library for building user interfaces in Python without Javascript. ReactPy interfaces are made from components which look and behave similarly to this found in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). Designed with simplicity in mind, ReactPy can be used by those without web development experience while also being powerful enough to grow with your ambitions.

# At a Glance

To get a rough idea of how to write apps in ReactPy, take a look at this tiny _Hello World_ application.

```python
from reactpy import component, html, run

@component
def HelloWorld():
    return html.h1("Hello, World!")

run(HelloWorld)
```
