# ReactPy &middot; [![Tests](https://github.com/reactive-python/reactpy/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/reactive-python/reactpy/actions?query=workflow%3ATest) [![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/reactpy.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reactpy) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-purple.svg)](https://github.com/reactive-python/reactpy/blob/main/LICENSE)

ReactPy is a library for building user interfaces in Python without Javascript. ReactPy
interfaces are made from components which look and behave similarly to this found in
[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). Designed with simplicity in mind, ReactPy can be used
by those without web development experience while also being powerful enough to grow
with your ambitions.

# At a Glance

To get a rough idea of how to write apps in ReactPy, take a look at this tiny _Hello World_ application.

```python
from reactpy import component, html, run

@component
def HelloWorld():
    return html.h1("Hello, World!")

run(HelloWorld)
```
