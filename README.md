# IDOM &middot; [![Tests](https://github.com/idom-team/idom/workflows/Test/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/idom-team/idom/actions?query=workflow%3ATest) [![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/idom.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/idom) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-purple.svg)](https://github.com/idom-team/idom/blob/main/LICENSE)

IDOM connects your Python web framework of choice to a ReactJS frontend, allowing you to create **interactive websites without needing JavaScript!**

Following ReactJS styling, web elements are combined into [reusable "components"](https://idom-docs.herokuapp.com/docs/guides/creating-interfaces/your-first-components/index.html#parametrizing-components). These components can utilize [hooks](https://idom-docs.herokuapp.com/docs/reference/hooks-api.html) and [events](https://idom-docs.herokuapp.com/docs/guides/adding-interactivity/responding-to-events/index.html#async-event-handlers) to create infinitely complex web pages.

When needed, IDOM can [use components directly from NPM](https://idom-docs.herokuapp.com/docs/guides/escape-hatches/javascript-components.html#dynamically-loaded-components). For additional flexibility, components can also be [fully developed in JavaScript](https://idom-docs.herokuapp.com/docs/guides/escape-hatches/javascript-components.html#custom-javascript-components).

Any Python web framework with Websockets can support IDOM. See below for what frameworks are supported out of the box.

| Supported Frameworks | Supported Frameworks (External) |
| --- | --- |
|  [`Flask`, `FastAPI`, `Sanic`, `Tornado`](https://idom-docs.herokuapp.com/docs/guides/getting-started/installing-idom.html#officially-supported-servers) | [`Django`](https://github.com/idom-team/django-idom), [`Plotly-Dash`](https://github.com/idom-team/idom-dash), [`Jupyter`](https://github.com/idom-team/idom-jupyter) |


# At a Glance

To get a rough idea of how to write apps in IDOM, take a look at this tiny _Hello World_ application.

```python
from idom import component, html, run

@component
def App():
    return html.h1("Hello, World!")

run(App)
```
